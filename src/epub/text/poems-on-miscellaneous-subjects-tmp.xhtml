		 Joy to my bosom ! rest to my fear !<br/>
		 Judea's prophet draweth near !<br/>
		 Joy to my bosom ! peace to my heart !<br/>
		 Sickness and sorrow before him depart !<br/>

		 Writhing, long my child has lain;<br/>

		 "Lord !" she cried with mournful breath,<br/>
		 "Save ! Oh, save my child from death !"<br/>

		 Jesus answered not a word.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 With a purpose nought could move.<br/>
		 And the zeal of woman's love,<br/>
		 Down she knelt in anguish wild —<br/>
		 "Master ! save, Oh ! save my child!"<br/>
		 <br/>
		 "'Tis not meet," the Saviour said,<br/>
		 "Thus to waste the children's bread ;<br/>
		 I am only sent to seek<br/>
		 Israel's lost and scattered sheep."<br/>
		 <br/>
		 "True," she said, "Oh gracious Lord !<br/>
		 True and faithful is thy word :<br/>
		 But the humblest, meanest, may<br/>
		 "Eat the crumbs they cast away."<br/>
		 <br/>
		 "Woman," said th' astonish'd Lord,<br/>
		 "Be it even as thy word !<br/>
		 By thy faith that knows no fail.<br/>
		 Thou hast ask'd, and shalt prevail."<br/>

		 Heard you that shriek ? It rose<br/>
		       So wildly on the air,<br/>
		 It seemed as if a burden'd heart<br/>
		       Was breaking in despair.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Saw you those hands so sadly clasped—<br/>
		      The bowed and feeble head —<br/>
		  The shuddering of that fragile form —<br/>
		      That look of grief and dread ?<br/>
		 <br/>
		Saw you the sad, imploring eye ?<br/>
		      Its every glance was pain,<br/>
		 As if a storm of agony<br/>
		     Were sweeping through the brain.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 She is a mother, pale with fear,<br/>
		      Her boy clings to her side,<br/>
		 And in her kirtle vainly tries<br/>
		      His trembling form to hide.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 He is not hers, although she bore<br/>
		      For him a mother's pains ;<br/>
		  He is not hers, although her blood<br/>
		      Is coursing through his veins !<br/>
		 <br/>
		 He is not hers, for cruel hands<br/>
		      May rudely tear apart<br/>
		 The only wreath of household love<br/>
		      That binds her breaking heart.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 His love has been a joyous light<br/>
		      That o'er her pathway smiled,<br/>
		  A fountain gushing ever new,<br/>
		      Amid life's desert wild.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 His lightest word has been a tone<br/>
		      Of music round her heart.<br/>
		 Their lives a streamlet blent in one-<br/>
		      Oh, Father ! must they part ?<br/>
		 <br/>
		 They tear him from her circling arms,<br/>
		      Her last and fond embrace ;<br/>
		  Oh ! never more may her sad eyes<br/>
		      Gaze on his mournful face.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 No marvel, then,  these bitter shrieks<br/>
		      Disturb the listening air :<br/>
		 She is a mother, and her heart<br/>
		       Is breaking in despair.<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Eliza Harris</h2>
		 Like a fawn from the arrow, startled and wild,<br/>
		 A woman swept by us, bearing a child ;<br/>
		 In her eye was the night of a settled despair,<br/>
		 And her brow was o'ershaded with anguish and care.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 She was nearing the river — in reaching the brink,<br/>
		 She heeded no danger, she paused not to think ;<br/>
		 For she is a mother — her child is a slave —<br/>
		 And she'll give him his freedom, or find him a grave !<br/>
		<br/>
		 It was a vision to haunt us, that innocent face —<br/>
		 So pale in its aspect, so fair in its grace ;<br/>
		 As the tramp of the horse and the bay of the hound,<br/>
		 With the fetters that gall, were trailing the ground !<br/>
		 <br/>
		 She was nerv'd by despair, and strengthened by woe,<br/>
		 As she leap'd o'er the chasms that yawn' d from below ;<br/>
		 Death howl'd in the tempest, and rav'd in the blast,<br/>
		 But she heard not the sound till the danger was past.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Oh ! how shall I speak of my proud country's shame ?<br/>
		 Of the stains on her glory, how give them their name ?<br/>
		 How say that her banner in mockery waves —<br/>
		 Her "star-spangled banner" — o'er millions of slaves ?<br/>
		 <br/>
		 How say that the lawless may torture and chase<br/>
		 A woman whose crime is the hue of her face ?<br/>
		 How the depths of the forest may echo around<br/>
		 With the shrieks of despair, and the bay of the hound?<br/>
		 <br/>
		 With her step on the ice, and her arm on her child,<br/>
		 The danger was fearful, the pathway was wild ;<br/>
		 But, aided by Heaven, she gained a free shore,<br/>
		 Where the friends of humanity open'd their door.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 So fragile and lovely, so fearfully pale,<br/>
		 Like a lily that bends to the breath of the gale,<br/>
		 Save the heave of her breast, and the sway of her hair,<br/>
		 You'd have thought her a statue of fear and despair.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 In agony close to her bosom she press'd<br/>
		 The life of her heart, the child of her breast : —<br/>
		 Oh ! love from its tenderness gathering might,<br/>
		 Had strengthen'd her soul for the dangers of flight.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 But she's free ! — yes, free from the land where the slave<br/>
		 From the hand of oppression must rest in the grave ;<br/>
		 Where bondage and torture, where scourges and chains<br/>
		 Have plac'd on our banner indelible stains.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 The bloodhounds have miss'd the scent of her way ;<br/>
		 The hunter is rifled and foil'd of his prey ;<br/>
		 Fierce jargon and cursing, with clanking of chains,<br/>
		 Make sounds of strange discord on Liberty's plains.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 With the rapture of love and fulness of bliss,<br/>
		 She plac'd on his brow a mother's fond kiss : —<br/>
		 Oh ! poverty, danger and death she can brave,<br/>
		 For the child of her love is no longer a slave !<br/>

		 He stood beside his dying child,<br/>
		     With a dim and bloodshot eye ;<br/>
		 They'd won him from the haunts of vice<br/>
		     To see his first-born die.<br/>
		 He came with a slow and staggering tread,<br/>
		     A vague, unmeaning stare,<br/>
		 And, reeling, clasped the clammy hand,<br/>
		     So deathly pale and fair.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 In a dark and gloomy chamber,<br/>
		     Life ebbing fast away,<br/>
		 On a coarse and wretched pallet,<br/>

		      Lit up the glazing eye ;<br/>
		 "I'm very glad,'' it seemed to say,<br/>
		     "You've come to see me die."<br/>
		 <br/>
		 That smile reached to his callous heart,<br/>
		     Its sealed fountains stirred ;<br/>
		 He tried to speak, but on his lips<br/>
		     Faltered and died each word.<br/>
		 And burning tears like rain<br/>
		     Poured down his bloated face.<br/>
		 Where guilt, remorse and shame<br/>
		     Had scathed, and left their trace.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 "My father!" said the dying child,<br/>
		     (His voice was faint and low,)<br/>
		 "Oh ! clasp me closely to your heart,<br/>
		     And kiss me ere I go.<br/>
		 Bright angels beckon me away,<br/>
		     To the holy city fair —<br/>
		 Oh ! tell me, father, ere I go.<br/>
		      Say, will you meet me there ?"<br/>
		 <br/>
		 He clasped him to his throbbing heart,<br/>
		      "I will! I will !" he said;<br/>
		 His pleading ceased — the father held<br/>
		      His first-born and his dead !<br/>
		 The marble brow, with golden curls.<br/>
		      Lay lifeless on his breast ;<br/>
		 Like sunbeams on the distant clouds<br/>
		      Which line the gorgeous west.<br/>

				<p epub:type="bridgehead">When the noble mother of Lovejoy heard of her son's death, she said, "It is well ! I had rather he should die so than desert his principles."</p>
			</header>
		 The murmurs of a distant strife<br/>
		     Fell on a mother's ear ;<br/>
		 Her son had yielded up his life,<br/>
		     Mid scenes of wrath and fear.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 They told her how he'd spent his breath<br/>
		     In pleading for the dumb,<br/>
		 And how the glorious martyr wreath<br/>
		     Her child had nobly won.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 They told her of his courage high,<br/>
		     Mid brutal force and might ;<br/>
		 How he had nerved himself to die<br/>
		     In battl'ng tor the right.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 It seemed as if a fearful storm<br/>
		     Swept wildly round her soul ;<br/>
		 A moment, and her fragile form<br/>
		     Bent 'neath its fierce control.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 From lip and brow the color fled —<br/>
		     But light flashed to her eye :<br/>
		 "'T is well ! 'tis well !" the mother said,<br/>
		     "That thus my child should die.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 "'T is well that, to his latest breath,<br/>
		     He plead for liberty ;<br/>
		 Truth nerved him for the hour of death,<br/>
		     And taught him how to die.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 "It taught him how to cast aside<br/>
		     Earth's honors and renown ;<br/>
		 To trample on her fame and pride,<br/>
		     And win a martyr's crown."<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Fugitive's Wife</h2>
		 It was my sad and weary lot<br/>
		     To toil in slavery ;<br/>
		 But one thing cheered my lowly cot —<br/>
		     My husband was with me.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 One evening, as our children played<br/>
		     Around our cabin door,<br/>
		 I noticed on his brow a shade<br/>
		     I'd never seen before ;<br/>
		 <br/>
		 And in his eyes a gloomy night<br/>
		     Of anguish and despair ; —<br/>
		 I gazed upon their troubled light,<br/>
		     To read the meaning there.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 He strained me to his heaving heart  —<br/>
		     My own beat wild with fear ;<br/>
		 I knew not, but I sadly felt<br/>
		     There must be evil near.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 He vainly' strove to east aside<br/>
		     The tears that fell like rain : —<br/>
		 Too frail, indeed, is manly pride,<br/>
		     To strive with grief and pain.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Again he clasped me to his breast,<br/>
		     And said that we must part :<br/>
		 I tried to speak — but, oh ! it seemed<br/>
		     An arrow reached my heart.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 ''Bear not !" I cried, "unto your grave,<br/>
		     The yoke you've borne from birth ;<br/>
		 No longer live a helpless slave,<br/>
		     The meanest thing on earth !"<br/>

		 They scorned her for her sinning,<br/>
		     Spoke harshly of her fall,<br/>
		 Nor lent the hand of mercy<br/>
		     To break her hated thrall.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 The dews of meek repentance<br/>
		     Stood in her downcast eye ;<br/>
		 Would no one heed her anguish ?<br/>
		     All pass her coldly by ?<br/>
		 <br/>
		 From the cold, averted glances<br/>
		     Of each reproachful eye,<br/>
		 She turned aside, heart-broken,<br/>
		     And laid her down to die.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 And where was he, who sullied<br/>
		     Her once unspotted name ;<br/>
		 Who lured her from life's brightness<br/>
		     To agony and shame ?<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Who left her on life's billows,<br/>

		 <br/>
		 Through the halls of wealth and fashion<br/>
		     In gaiety and pride,<br/>
		 He was leading to the altar<br/>
		     A fair and lovely bride !<br/>
		 <br/>
		 None scorned him for his sinning,<br/>
		     Few saw it through his gold ;<br/>
		 His crimes were only foibles,<br/>
		     And these were gently told.<br/>
		     <br/>
		 Before him rose a vision,<br/>
		     A maid of beauty rare ;<br/>
		 Then a pale, heart-broken woman,<br/>
		     The image of despair.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Next came a sad procession,<br/>
		    With many a sob and tear ;<br/>
		 A widow' d, childless mother<br/>
		     Totter'd by an humble bier.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 The vision quickly faded,<br/>
		     The sad, unwelcome sight;<br/>
		 But his lip forgot its laughter.<br/>
		     And his eye its careless light.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 A moment, and the flood-gates<br/>
		     Of memory opened wide ;<br/>
		 And remorseful recollection<br/>
		     Flowed like a lava tide.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 That widow's wail of anguish<br/>
		     Seemed strangely 'blending there,<br/>

		 He came — a wanderer ; years of sin<br/>
		     Had blanched his blooming cheek,<br/>
		 Telling a tale of strife within.<br/>
		     That words might vainly speak.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 His feet were bare, his garments torn,<br/>

		     Room to scatter, rend and slay,<br/>

		 I have but four, the treasures of my soul,<br/>
		     They lay like doves around my heart ;<br/>
		 I tremble lest some cruel hand<br/>
		     Should tear my household wreaths apart.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 My baby girl, with childish glance,<br/>
		     Looks curious in my anxious eye,<br/>
		 She little knows that for her sake<br/>
		     Deep shadows round my spirit lie.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 My playful boys could I forget.<br/>
		     My home might seem a joyous spot,<br/>
		 But with their sunshine mirth I blend<br/>
		     The darkness of their future lot.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 And thou my babe, my darling one,<br/>
		     My last, my loved, my precious child,<br/>
		 Oh ! when I think upon thy doom<br/>
		     My heart grows faint and then throbs wild.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 The Ohio's bridged and spanned with ice.<br/>
		     The northern star is shining bright,<br/>
		 I'll take the nestlings of my heart<br/>
		     And search for freedom by its light.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Winter and night were on the earth,<br/>
		     And feebly moaned the shivering trees,<br/>
		 A sigh of winter seemed to run<br/>
		     Through every murmur of the breeze.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 She fled, and with her children all,<br/>
		     She reached the stream and crossed it o'er,<br/>
		 Bright visions of deliverance came<br/>
		     Like dreams of plenty to the poor.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Dreams ! vain dreams, heroic mother,<br/>
		     Give all thy hopes and struggles o'er,<br/>
		 The pursuer is on thy track,<br/>
		     And the hunter at thy door.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Judea's refuge cities had power<br/>
		     To shelter, shield and save,<br/>
		 E'en Rome had altars ; 'neath whose shade<br/>
		     Might crouch the wan and weary slave.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 But Ohio had no sacred fane,<br/>
		     To human rights so consecrate,<br/>
		 Where thou may'st shield thy hapless ones<br/>
		     From their darkly gathering fate.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Then, said the mournful mother,<br/>
		     If Ohio cannot save,<br/>
		 I will do a deed for freedom.<br/>
		     She shall find each child a grave.<br/>
		<br/>
		 I will save my precious children<br/>

		 Sends this deed of fearful daring<br/>

		     The wealth of woman's love.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Go where thou wilt, my steps are there,<br/>
		     Our path in life is one ;<br/>
		 Thou hast no lot I will not share,<br/>
		     'Till life itself be done.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 My country and my home for thee,<br/>
		     I freely, willingly resign,<br/>
		 Thy people shall my people be,<br/>
		     Thy God he shall be mine.<br/>
		 <br/>
		 Then, mother dear, entreat me not<br/>
		     To turn from following thee ;<br/>
		 My heart is nerved to share thy lot,<br/>
		     Whatever that may be.<br/>
