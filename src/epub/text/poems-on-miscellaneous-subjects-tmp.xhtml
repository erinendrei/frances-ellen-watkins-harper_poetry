v#Joy to my bosom ! rest to my fear !
v#Judea's prophet draweth near !
v#Joy to my bosom ! peace to my heart !
v#Sickness and sorrow before him depart !
</p>
<p>
v#Racked with agony and pain,
v#Writhing, long my child has lain;
v#Now the prophet draweth near,
v#All our griefs shall disappear.
</p>
<p>
v#"Lord !" she cried with mournful breath,
v#"Save ! Oh, save my child from death !"
v#But as though she was unheard,
v#Jesus answered not a word.
</p>
<p>
v#With a purpose nought could move.
v#And the zeal of woman's love,
v#Down she knelt in anguish wild —
v#"Master ! save, Oh ! save my child!"
</p>
<p>
v#"'Tis not meet," the Saviour said,
v#"Thus to waste the children's bread ;
v#I am only sent to seek
v#Israel's lost and scattered sheep."
</p>
<p>
v#"True," she said, "Oh gracious Lord !
v#True and faithful is thy word :
v#But the humblest, meanest, may
v#"Eat the crumbs they cast away."
</p>
<p>
v#"Woman," said th' astonish'd Lord,
v#"Be it even as thy word !
v#By thy faith that knows no fail.
v#Thou hast ask'd, and shalt prevail."

v#Heard you that shriek ? It rose
v##So wildly on the air,
v#It seemed as if a burden'd heart
v##Was breaking in despair.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Saw you those hands so sadly clasped—
v##The bowed and feeble head —
v#The shuddering of that fragile form —
v##That look of grief and dread ?
		</p>
		<p>
v#Saw you the sad, imploring eye ?
v##Its every glance was pain,
v#As if a storm of agony
v##Were sweeping through the brain.
		</p>
		<p>
v#She is a mother, pale with fear,
v##Her boy clings to her side,
v#And in her kirtle vainly tries
v##His trembling form to hide.
		</p>
		<p>
v#He is not hers, although she bore
v##For him a mother's pains ;
v#He is not hers, although her blood
v##Is coursing through his veins !
		</p>
		<p>
v#He is not hers, for cruel hands
v##May rudely tear apart
v#The only wreath of household love
v##That binds her breaking heart.
		</p>
		<p>
v#His love has been a joyous light
v##That o'er her pathway smiled,
v#A fountain gushing ever new,
v##Amid life's desert wild.
		</p>
		<p>
v#His lightest word has been a tone
v##Of music round her heart.
v#Their lives a streamlet blent in one-
v##Oh, Father ! must they part ?
		</p>
		<p>
v#They tear him from her circling arms,
v##Her last and fond embrace ;
v#Oh ! never more may her sad eyes
v##Gaze on his mournful face.
		</p>
		<p>
v#No marvel, then,  these bitter shrieks
v##Disturb the listening air :
v#She is a mother, and her heart
v##Is breaking in despair.

			<p>
v#Like a fawn from the arrow, startled and wild,
v#A woman swept by us, bearing a child ;
v#In her eye was the night of a settled despair,
v#And her brow was o'ershaded with anguish and care.
		</p>
		<p>
v#She was nearing the river — in reaching the brink,
v#She heeded no danger, she paused not to think ;
v#For she is a mother — her child is a slave —
v#And she'll give him his freedom, or find him a grave !
		</p>
		<p>
v#It was a vision to haunt us, that innocent face —
v#So pale in its aspect, so fair in its grace ;
v#As the tramp of the horse and the bay of the hound,
v#With the fetters that gall, were trailing the ground !
		</p>
		<p>
v#She was nerv'd by despair, and strengthened by woe,
v#As she leap'd o'er the chasms that yawn' d from below ;
v#Death howl'd in the tempest, and rav'd in the blast,
v#But she heard not the sound till the danger was past.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Oh ! how shall I speak of my proud country's shame ?
v#Of the stains on her glory, how give them their name ?
v#How say that her banner in mockery waves —
v#Her "star-spangled banner" — o'er millions of slaves ?
		</p>
		<p>
v#How say that the lawless may torture and chase
v#A woman whose crime is the hue of her face ?
v#How the depths of the forest may echo around
v#With the shrieks of despair, and the bay of the hound?
		</p>
		<p>
v#With her step on the ice, and her arm on her child,
v#The danger was fearful, the pathway was wild ;
v#But, aided by Heaven, she gained a free shore,
v#Where the friends of humanity open'd their door.
		</p>
		<p>
v#So fragile and lovely, so fearfully pale,
v#Like a lily that bends to the breath of the gale,
v#Save the heave of her breast, and the sway of her hair,
v#You'd have thought her a statue of fear and despair.
		</p>
		<p>
v#In agony close to her bosom she press'd
v#The life of her heart, the child of her breast : —
v#Oh ! love from its tenderness gathering might,
v#Had strengthen'd her soul for the dangers of flight.
		</p>
		<p>
v#But she's free ! — yes, free from the land where the slave
v#From the hand of oppression must rest in the grave ;
v#Where bondage and torture, where scourges and chains
v#Have plac'd on our banner indelible stains.
		</p>
		<p>
v#The bloodhounds have miss'd the scent of her way ;
v#The hunter is rifled and foil'd of his prey ;
v#Fierce jargon and cursing, with clanking of chains,
v#Make sounds of strange discord on Liberty's plains.
		</p>
		<p>
v#With the rapture of love and fulness of bliss,
v#She plac'd on his brow a mother's fond kiss : —
v#Oh ! poverty, danger and death she can brave,
v#For the child of her love is no longer a slave !

v#He stood beside his dying child,
v##With a dim and bloodshot eye ;
v#They'd won him from the haunts of vice
v##To see his first-born die.
v#He came with a slow and staggering tread,
v##A vague, unmeaning stare,
v#And, reeling, clasped the clammy hand,
v##So deathly pale and fair.
		</p>
		<p>
v#In a dark and gloomy chamber,
v##Life ebbing fast away,
v#On a coarse and wretched pallet,
v##The dying sufferer lay :
v#A smile of recognition
v##Lit up the glazing eye ;
v#"I'm very glad,'' it seemed to say,
v##"You've come to see me die."
		</p>
		<p>
v#That smile reached to his callous heart,
v##Its sealed fountains stirred ;
v#He tried to speak, but on his lips
v##Faltered and died each word.
v#And burning tears like rain
v##Poured down his bloated face.
v#Where guilt, remorse and shame
v##Had scathed, and left their trace.
		</p>
		<p>
v#"My father!" said the dying child,
v##(His voice was faint and low,)
v#"Oh ! clasp me closely to your heart,
v##And kiss me ere I go.
v#Bright angels beckon me away,
v##To the holy city fair —
v#Oh ! tell me, father, ere I go.
v##Say, will you meet me there ?"
		</p>
		<p>
v#He clasped him to his throbbing heart,
v##"I will! I will !" he said;
v#His pleading ceased — the father held
v##His first-born and his dead !
v#The marble brow, with golden curls.
v##Lay lifeless on his breast ;
v#Like sunbeams on the distant clouds
v##Which line the gorgeous west.

v##Should tear my household wreaths apart.

		<p>
v#My baby girl, with childish glance,
v##Looks curious in my anxious eye,
v#She little knows that for her sake
v##Deep shadows round my spirit lie.
		</p>
		<p>
v#My playful boys could I forget.
v##My home might seem a joyous spot,
v#But with their sunshine mirth I blend
v##The darkness of their future lot.
		</p>
		<p>
v#And thou my babe, my darling one,
v##My last, my loved, my precious child,
v#Oh ! when I think upon thy doom
v##My heart grows faint and then throbs wild.
		</p>
		<p>
v#The Ohio's bridged and spanned with ice.
v##The northern star is shining bright,
v#I'll take the nestlings of my heart
v##And search for freedom by its light.

v#Winter and night were on the earth,
v##And feebly moaned the shivering trees,
v#A sigh of winter seemed to run
v##Through every murmur of the breeze.

v#She fled, and with her children all,
v##She reached the stream and crossed it o'er,
v#Bright visions of deliverance came
v##Like dreams of plenty to the poor.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Dreams ! vain dreams, heroic mother,
v##Give all thy hopes and struggles o'er,
v#The pursuer is on thy track,
v##And the hunter at thy door.

v#Judea's refuge cities had power
v##To shelter, shield and save,
v#E'en Rome had altars ; 'neath whose shade
v##Might crouch the wan and weary slave.

v#But Ohio had no sacred fane,
v##To human rights so consecrate,
v#Where thou may'st shield thy hapless ones
v##From their darkly gathering fate.
		</p>
		<p>
v#Then, said the mournful mother,
v##If Ohio cannot save,
v#I will do a deed for freedom.
v##She shall find each child a grave.
