			<h2 epub:type="title">Aunt Chloe</h2>
			<p>
				<span>I remember, well remember,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That dark and dreadful day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they whispered to me, “Chloe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your children’s sold away!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It seemed as if a bullet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had shot me through and through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt as if my heart-strings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was breaking right in two.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I says to cousin Milly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“There must be some mistake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where’s Mistus?” “In the great house crying⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crying like her heart would break.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And the lawyer’s there with Mistus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Says he’s come to ’ministrate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Cause when master died he just left</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heap of debt on the estate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I thought ’twould do you good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bid your boys good-bye⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To kiss them both and shake their hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And have a hearty cry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh! Chloe, I knows how you feel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Cause I’se been through it all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought my poor old heart would break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When master sold my Saul.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just then I heard the footsteps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of my children at the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I rose right up to meet them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I fell upon the floor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I heard poor Jakey saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Oh, mammy, don’t you cry!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt my children kiss me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bid me, both, good-bye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I had a mighty sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I nursed it all alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I wasted to a shadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turned to skin and bone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But one day dear Uncle Jacob</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(In heaven he’s now a saint)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said, “Your poor heart is in the fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But child you must not faint.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I said to Uncle Jacob,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I was good like you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the heavy trouble dashed me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’d know just what to do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he said to me, “Poor Chloe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The way is open wide:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he told me of the Saviour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the fountain in His side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he said “Just take your burden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the blessed Master’s feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I takes all my troubles, Chloe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right unto the mercy-seat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His words waked up my courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I began to pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt my heavy burden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rolling like a stone away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And a something seemed to tell me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You will see your boys again⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that hope was like a poultice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spread upon a dreadful pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And it often seemed to whisper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chloe, trust and never fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You’ll get justice in the kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you do not get it here.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Deliverance</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Master only left old Mistus</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One bright and handsome boy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she fairly doted on him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was her pride and joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We all liked Mister Thomas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was so kind at heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the young folks got in scrapes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He always took their part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He kept right on that very way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he got big and tall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And old Mistus used to chide him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And say he’d spile us all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But somehow the farm did prosper</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he took things in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though all the servants liked him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made them understand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One evening Mister Thomas said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Just bring my easy shoes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am going to sit by mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And read her up the news.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon I heard him tell old Mistus</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“We’re bound to have a fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we’ll whip the Yankees, mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We’ll whip them sure as night!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I saw old Mistus tremble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She gasped and held her breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she looked on Mister Thomas</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a face as pale as death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They are firing on Fort Sumpter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! I wish that I was there!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why, dear mother! what’s the matter?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You’re the picture of despair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I was thinking, dearest Thomas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould break my very heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If a fierce and dreadful battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should tear our lives apart.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“None but cowards, dearest mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would skulk unto the rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the tyrant’s hand is shaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the heart is holding dear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I felt sorry for old Mistus;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She got too full to speak;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I saw the great big tear-drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A running down her cheek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mister Thomas too was troubled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With choosing on that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt staying with his mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joining in the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon down into the village came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A call for volunteers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mistus gave up Mister Thomas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many sighs and tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His uniform was real handsome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He looked so brave and strong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But somehow I couldn’t help thinking</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fighting must be wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though the house was very lonesome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I thought ’twould all come right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I felt somehow or other</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We was mixed up in that fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I said to Uncle Jacob,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Now old Mistus feels the sting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this parting with your children</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is a mighty dreadful thing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Never mind,” said Uncle Jacob,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Just wait and watch and pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I feel right sure and certain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slavery’s bound to pass away;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Because I asked the Spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If God is good and just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How it happened that the masters</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did grind us to the dust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And something reasoned right inside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such should not always be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you could not beat it out my head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Spirit spoke to me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And his dear old eyes would brighten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his lips put on a smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “Pick up faith and courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And just wait a little while.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mistus prayed up in the parlor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the Secesh all might win;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We were praying in the cabins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wanting freedom to begin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mister Thomas wrote to Mistus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Telling ’bout the Bull’s Run fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his troops had whipped the Yankees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put them all to flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mistus’ eyes did fairly glisten;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She laughed and praised the South,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I thought some day she’d laugh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On tother side her mouth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I used to watch old Mistus’ face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when it looked quite long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would say to Cousin Milly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The battle’s going wrong;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not for us, but for the Rebels.⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart ’would fairly skip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Uncle Jacob used to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The North is bound to whip.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And let the fight go as it would⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let North or South prevail⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He always kept his courage up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And never let it fail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he often used to tell us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Children, don’t forget to pray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the darkest time of morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is just ’fore the break of day.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well, one morning bright and early</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We heard the fife and drum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the booming of the cannon⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Yankee troops had come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the word ran through the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The colored folks are free⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kitchens and the cabins</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We held a jubilee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they told us Mister Lincoln</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Said that slavery was dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We just poured our prayers and blessings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his precious head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We just laughed, and danced, and shouted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prayed, and sang, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we thought dear Uncle Jacob</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fairly crack his side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when old Mistus heard it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She groaned and hardly spoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she had to lose her servants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her heart was almost broke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas a sight to see our people</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Going out, the troops to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost dancing to the music,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And marching down the street.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After years of pain and parting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our chains was broke in two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we was so mighty happy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We didn’t know what to do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we soon got used to freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though the way at first was rough;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But we weathered through the tempest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For slavery made us tough.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we had one awful sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It almost turned my head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a mean and wicked cretur</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shot Mister Lincoln dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas a dreadful solemn morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I just staggered on my feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the women they were crying</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And screaming in the street.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But if many prayers and blessings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could bear him to the throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should think when Mister Lincoln died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That heaven just got its own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then we had another President⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What do you call his name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, if the colored folks forget him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They wouldn’t be much to blame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We thought he’d be the Moses</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the colored race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the Rebels pressed us hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never showed his face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But something must have happened him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right curi’s I’ll be bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Cause I heard ’em talking ’bout a circle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he was swinging round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But everything will pass away⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He went like time and tide⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the next election came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They let poor Andy slide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now we have a President,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if I was a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d vote for him for breaking up</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wicked Ku Klux Klan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And if any man should ask me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I would sell my vote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’d tell him I was not the one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To change and turn my coat;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If freedom seem’d a little rough</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’d weather through the gale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as to buying up my vote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hadn’t it for sale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I do not think I’d ever be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As slack as Jonas Handy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I heard he sold his vote</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For just three sticks of candy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when John Thomas Reeder brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wife some flour and meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told her he had sold his vote</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For something good to eat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You ought to seen Aunt Kitty raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heard her blaze away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gave the meat and flour a toss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said they should not stay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I should think he felt quite cheap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For voting the wrong side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when Aunt Kitty scolded him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He just stood up and cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the worst fooled man I ever saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was when poor David Rand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sold out for flour and sugar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sugar was mixed with sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I’ll tell you how the thing got out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wife had company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she thought the sand was sugar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And served it up for tea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When David sipped and sipped the tea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Somehow it didn’t taste right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I guess when he found he was sipping sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was mad enough to fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sugar looked so nice and white⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was spread some inches deep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But underneath was a lot of sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such sugar is mighty cheap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You’d laughed to seen Lucinda Grange</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her husband’s track;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he sold his vote for rations</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She made him take ’em back.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Day after day did Milly Green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just follow after Joe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told him if he voted wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take his rags and go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think that Curnel Johnson said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His side had won the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not we women radicals</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just got right in the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet I would not have you think</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all our men are shabby;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ’tis said in every flock of sheep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There will be one that’s scabby.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I’ve heard, before election came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They tried to buy John Slade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he gave them all to understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he wasn’t in that trade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And we’ve got lots of other men</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who rally round the cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And go for holding up the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gave us equal laws.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who know their freedom cost too much</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of blood and pain and treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For them to fool away their votes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For profit or for pleasure.</span>

				<span class="i1">As an egg is full of meat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now I don’t believe in looking</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Honest people in the face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saying when you’re doing wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That “I haven’t sold my race.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When we want to school our children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If the money isn’t there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether black or white have took it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loss we all must share.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this buying up each other</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is something worse than mean,</span>

				<span>Though I thinks a heap of voting,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Very soon the Yankee teachers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came down and set up school;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, oh! how the Rebs did hate it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was agin’ their rule.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our masters always tried to hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Book learning from our eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowledge didn’t agree with slavery⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould make us all too wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But some of us would try to steal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A little from the book,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And put the words together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And learn by hook or crook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I remember Uncle Caldwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who took pot-liquor fat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And greased the pages of his book,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hid it in his hat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And had his master ever seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The leaves upon his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’d have thought them greasy papers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But nothing to be read.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there was Mr. Turner’s Ben,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who heard the children spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And picked the words right up by heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And learned to read ’em well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well, the Northern folks kept sending</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Yankee teachers down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they stood right up and helped us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though Rebs did sneer and frown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, I longed to read my Bible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For precious words it said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when I begun to learn it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Folks just shook their heads,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And said there is no use trying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! Chloe, you’re too late;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as I was rising sixty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I had no time to wait.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So I got a pair of glasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight to work I went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never stopped till I could read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hymns and Testament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then I got a little cabin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A place to call my own⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I felt as independent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the queen upon her throne.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Uncle Jacob often told us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since freedom blessed our race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We ought all to come together</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And build a meeting place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So we pinched, and scraped, and spared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A little here and there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though our wages was but scanty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The church did get a share.</span>

			<p>
				<span>And, when the house was finished,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>He was looking mighty feeble,</span>

				<span class="i1">And his head was awful gray.</span>

			<p>
				<span>But his voice rang like a trumpet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His eyes looked bright and young;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And it seemed a mighty power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was resting on his tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he gave us all his blessing⁠—</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">The dear old man was dead.</span>

			<p>
				<span>But I believe he’s in the kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For when we shook his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said, “Children, you must meet me</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For when I’m done a moiling</span>

				<span>Well, one morning real early</span>

				<span class="i1">I was going down the street,</span>

				<span>There was a something in his voice</span>

			<p>
				<span>I grasped him tight, and took him home⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What gladness filled my cup!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I laughed, and just rolled over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laughed, and just give up.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Where have you been? O Jakey, dear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why didn’t you come before?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh! when you children went away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart was awful sore.”</span>

				<span>“Why, mammy, I’ve been on your hunt</span>

				<span class="i1">Since ever I’ve been free,</span>

				<span>Come, gather around me, children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a story I will tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How we builded the beautiful temple⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The temple we love so well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I must date my story backward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a distant age and land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When God did break our fathers’ chains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By his mighty outstretched hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our fathers were strangers and captives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the ancient Nile doth flow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smitten by cruel taskmasters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And burdened by toil and woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As a shepherd, to pastures green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doth lead with care his sheep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So God divided the great Red Sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And led them through the deep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You’ve seen me plant a tender vine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And guard it with patient care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till its roots struck in the mellow earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it drank the light and air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So God did plant our chosen race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As a vine in this fair land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we grew and spread a fruitful tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The planting of his right hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The time would fail strove I to tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the story of our race⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our grand old leader, Moses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Joshua in his place,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of all our rulers and judges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Joshua unto Saul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over whose doomed and guilty head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell ruin and death’s dark pall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of valiant Jephthah, whose brave heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sudden grief did bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his daughter came with dance and song</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unconscious of his vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Gideon, lifting up his voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who rules the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wringing out his well drenched fleece,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When all around was dry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How Deborah, ’neath her spreading palms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A judge in Israel rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrested victory from the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Jacob’s heathen foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Samuel, an upright judge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The last who ruled our tribes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose noble life and cleanly hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were pure and free from bribes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of David, with his checkered life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our tuneful minstrel king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who breathed in sadness and delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The psalms we love to sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Solomon, whose wandering heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Jacob’s God did stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast the richest gifts of life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pleasure’s cup away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How aged men advised his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But found him weak and vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the kingdom from his hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was rudely rent in twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! sin and strife are fearful things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They widen as they go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leave behind them shades of death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And open gates of woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A trail of guilt, a gloomy line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ran through our nation’s life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wicked kings provoked our God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sin and woe were rife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At length, there came a day of doom⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A day of grief and dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When judgment like a fearful storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swept o’er our country’s head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And we were captives many years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Babel’s stream doth flow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With harps unstrung, on willows hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We wept in silent woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We could not sing the old, sweet songs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our captors asked to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hearts were full, how could we sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The songs to us so dear?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As one who dreams a mournful dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which fades, as wanes the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So God did change our gloomy lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From darkness into light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Belshazzar in his regal halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sumptuous feast did hold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He praised his gods and drank his wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From sacred cups of gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When dance and song and revelry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had filled with mirth each hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belshazzar raised his eyes and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A writing on the wall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He saw, and horror blanched his cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lips were white with fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To read the words he quickly called</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For wise men, far and near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But baffled seers, with anxious doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood silent in the room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Daniel came, a captive youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And read the words of doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That night, within his regal hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Belshazzar lifeless lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Persians grasped his fallen crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the Mede held sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Darius came, and Daniel rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A man of high renown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wicked courtiers schemed and planned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To drag the prophet down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They came as men who wished to place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Great honors on their king⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With flattering lips and oily words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desired a certain thing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They knew that Daniel, day by day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Salem turned his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And asked the king to sign a law</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hands might not erase.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That till one moon had waned away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No cherished wish or thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should any ask of men or Gods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless it were the king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Daniel, full of holy trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His windows opened wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Regardless of the king’s command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto his God he cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They brought him forth that he might be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hungry lion’s meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awe struck, the lions turned away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And crouched anear his feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The God he served was strong to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His servant in the den;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fate devised for Daniel’s life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er took those scheming men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Cyrus came, a gracious king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave the blest command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we, the scattered Jews, should build</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew our fallen land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The men who hated Judah’s weal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were filled with bitter rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ’gainst the progress of our work</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did evil men engage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sanballat tried to hinder us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Gashmu uttered lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a thing of joy and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We saw our temple rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And from the tower of Hananeel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto the corner gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We built the wall and did restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The places desolate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some mocked us as we labored on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scoffingly did say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If but a fox climb on the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their work will give away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Nehemiah wrought in hope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though heathen foes did frown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My work is great,” he firmly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And I cannot come down.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when Shemai counselled him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The temple door to close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hide, lest he should fall a prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto his cruel foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strong in his faith, he answered, “No,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would oppose the tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should such as he from danger flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the temple hide?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We wrought in earnest faith and hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until we built the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then, unto a joyful feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did priest and people call.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We came to dedicate the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sacrifice and joy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A happy throng, from aged sire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto the fair-haired boy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our lips so used to mournful songs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did joyous laughter fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strong men wept with sacred joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stand on Zion’s hill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mid scoffing foes and evil men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We built our city blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ’neath our sheltering vines and palms</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To-day in peace we rest.</span>

				<span>Snowflakes falling o’er mother’s grave</span>

			<p>
				<span>Missing to-night the charming bliss,</span>

				<span>It is nothing to me, the beauty said,</span>

				<span>With a careless toss of her pretty head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man is weak if he can’t refrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cup you say is fraught with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to her in after years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When her eyes were drenched with burning tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she watched in lonely grief and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And startled to hear a staggering tread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is nothing to me, the mother said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have no fear that my boy will tread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the downward path of sin and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crush my heart and darken his name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to her when that only son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the path of right was early won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madly cast in the flowing bowl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ruined body and sin-wrecked soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is nothing to me, the young man cried:</span>

				<span>In his eye was a flash of scorn and pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heed not the dreadful things ye tell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can rule myself I know full well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to him when in prison he lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The victim of drink, life ebbing away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought of his wretched child and wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mournful wreck of his wasted life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is nothing to me, the merchant said,</span>

				<span>As over his ledger he bent his head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’m busy to-day with tare and tret,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have no time to fume and fret.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was something to him when over the wire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A message came from a funeral pyre⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A drunken conductor had wrecked a train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his wife and child were among the slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It is nothing to me, the voter said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The party’s loss is my greatest dread;</span>

				<span>Then gave his vote for the liquor trade,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And trembled to hear their father’s tread.</span>

				<span>Is it nothing for us to idly sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the cohorts of death their vigils keep?</span>

				<span>To gather the young and thoughtless in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grind in our midst a grist of sin?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is something, yes, all, for us to stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clasping by faith our Saviour’s hand;</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The music of a myriad harps</span>

				<span class="i1">Flowed out with sweet accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saints were casting down their crowns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In homage to our Lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My heart leaped up with untold joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Life’s toil and pain were o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My weary feet at last had found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bright and restful shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Just as I reached the gates of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ready to enter in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From earth arose a fearful cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sorrow and of sin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I turned, and saw behind me surge</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wild and stormy sea;</span>

				<span class="i1">Imploring hands to me.</span>

				<span>The music of the golden harps</span>

				<span class="i1">Grew fainter for their grief.</span>

				<span>My work is with these wretched ones,</span>

				<span class="i1">So wrecked and desolate.</span>

				<span>An angel smiled and gently said:</span>
