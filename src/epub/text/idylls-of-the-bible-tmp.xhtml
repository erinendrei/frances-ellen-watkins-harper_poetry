	THE PARTING.—CHAPTER I.<br/>
	<br/>
	MOSES.<br/>
	Kind and gracious princess, more than friend,<br/>
	I've come to thank thee for thy goodness,<br/>
	And to breathe into thy generous ears<br/>
	My last and sad farewell. I go to join<br/>
	The fortunes of my race, and to put aside<br/>
	All other bright advantages, save<br/>
	The approval of my conscience and the meed<br/>
	Of rightly doing.<br/>
	<br/>
	PRINCESS.<br/>
	What means, my son, this strange election?<br/>
	What wild chimera floats across thy mind?<br/>
	What sudden impulse moves thy soul? Thou who<br/>
	Hast only trod the court of kings, why seek<br/>
	Instead the paths of labor? Thou, whose limbs<br/>
	Have known no other garb than that which well<br/>
	Befits our kingly state, why rather choose<br/>
	The badge of servitude and toil?<br/>
	<br/>
	MOSES.<br/>
	Let me tell thee, gracious princess; 'tis no<br/>
	Sudden freak nor impulse wild that moves my mind.<br/>
	I feel an earnest purpose binding all<br/>
	My soul unto a strong resolve, which bids<br/>
	Me put aside all other ends and aims,<br/>
	Until the hour shall come when God—the God<br/>
	Our fathers loved and worshipped—shall break our chains,<br/>
	And lead our willing feet to freedom.<br/>
	<br/>
	PRINCESS.<br/>
	Listen to me, Moses: thou art young,<br/>
	And the warm blood of youth flushes thy veins<br/>
	Like generous wine; thou wearest thy manhood<br/>
	Like a crown; but what king e'er cast<br/>
	His diadem in the dust, to be trampled<br/>
	Down by every careless foot? Thou hast<br/>
	Bright dreams and glowing hopes; could’st thou not live<br/>
	Them out as well beneath the radiance<br/>
	Of our throne as in the shadow of those<br/>
	Bondage-darkened huts?<br/>
	<br/>
	MOSES.<br/>
	Within those darkened huts my mother plies her tasks,<br/>
	My father bends to unrequited toil;<br/>
	And bitter tears moisten the bread my brethren eat.<br/>
	And when I gaze upon their cruel wrongs<br/>
	The very purple on my limbs seems drenched<br/>
	With blood, the warm blood of my own kindred race;<br/>
	And then thy richest viands pall upon my taste,<br/>
	And discord jars in every tone of song.<br/>
	I cannot live in pleasure while they faint<br/>
	In pain.<br/>
	<br/>
	PRINCESS.<br/>
	How like a dream the past floats bạck: it seems<br/>
	But yesterday when I lay tossing upon<br/>
	My couch of pain, a torpor creeping through<br/>
	Each nerve, a fever coursing through my veins.<br/>
	And there I lay, dreaming of lilies fair,<br/>
	Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all<br/>
	The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life<br/>
	Its glow and flush; and thus day after day<br/>
	Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn,<br/>
	The breath of lilies, fainting on the air,<br/>
	Floated into my room, and then I longed once more<br/>
	To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face<br/>
	Of a familiar friend, whose absence long<br/>
	Had made a mournful void within the heart.<br/>
	I summoned to my side my maids, and bade<br/>
	Them place my sandals on my feet, and lead<br/>
	Me to the Nile, where I might bathe my weary<br/>
	Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather<br/>
	Healing from the sacred stream.<br/>
	I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found<br/>
	New tides of vigor coursing through my veins.<br/>
	Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves<br/>
	And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet<br/>
	Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw<br/>
	A little wicker-basket hidden among<br/>
	The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called<br/>
	My maidens and said, “Nillias and Osiria<br/>
	Bring me that little ark which floats beside<br/>
	The stream.” They ran and brought me a precious burden.<br/>
	'Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed<br/>
	With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child;<br/>
	His little hand amid his clustering curls,<br/>
	And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek.<br/>
	He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand<br/>
	To meet the welcome of the mother's kiss,<br/>
	When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back<br/>
	With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment<br/>
	Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother's<br/>
	Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept.<br/>
	Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved<br/>
	That I would brave my father's wrath and save<br/>
	The child; but while I stood gazing upon<br/>
	His wondrous beauty, I saw beside<br/>
	A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me<br/>
	With an eager, questioning look, and drawing<br/>
	Near, she timidly said, “shall I call a nurse?”<br/>
	I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her<br/>
	Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose<br/>
	Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing<br/>
	With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe<br/>
	Within her arms and said, “Nurse this child for me;"<br/>
	And the babe nestled there like one at home,<br/>
	While o'er the dimples of his face rippled<br/>
	The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well<br/>
	Content to leave him in her care; and well<br/>
	Did she perform her part. When many days had<br/>
	Passed she brought the child unto the palace;<br/>
	And one morning, while I sat toying with<br/>
	His curls and listening to the prattle of his<br/>
	Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately,<br/>
	Saw me bending o’er the child and said,<br/>
	“Charmain, whose child is this? who of my lords<br/>
	Calls himself father to this goodly child?<br/>
	He surely must be a happy man.”<br/>
	          Then I said, “Father, he is mine. He is a<br/>
	Hebrew child that I have saved from death." He<br/>
	Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder<br/>
	Had stung him, and said, "Charmian, take that<br/>
	Child hence. How darest thou bring a member<br/>
	Of that mean and servile race within my doors?<br/>
	Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose<br/>
	Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.<br/>
	Then kneeling at his feet, and catching<br/>
	Hold of his royal robes, I said, “Not so,<br/>
	Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched<br/>
	Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled<br/>
	The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has<br/>
	Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy<br/>
	Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has<br/>
	A claim upon thy mercy.”<br/>
	                                                  “Charmian," he said,<br/>
	“I have decreed that every man child of that<br/>
	Hated race shall die. The oracles have said<br/>
	The pyramids shall wane before their shadow,<br/>
	And from them a star shall rise whose light shall<br/>
	Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why<br/>
	I root them from the land; their strength is weakness<br/>
	To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they<br/>
	Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian,<br/>
	Give me up the child, and let him die.”<br/>
	Then clasping the child closer to my heart,<br/>
	I said, "the pathway to his life is through my own;<br/>
	Around that life I throw my heart, a wall<br/>
	Of living, loving clay.” Dark as the thunder<br/>
	Clouds of distant lands became my father's brow,<br/>
	And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings<br/>
	Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager<br/>
	Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come<br/>
	Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted<br/>
	Tenderness, and he said, “Charmian, arise,<br/>
	Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother<br/>
	Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath<br/>
	Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light<br/>
	Of my home; the star that faded out too<br/>
	Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life<br/>
	To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake,<br/>
	Not thine, I'll spare the child.” And thus I saved<br/>
	Thee twice-once from the angry sword and once<br/>
	From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art<br/>
	Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such<br/>
	I claim thee now. I've nursed no other child<br/>
	Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other<br/>
	Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now,<br/>
	With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love.<br/>
	There was a painful silence, a silence<br/>
	So hushed and still that you might have almost<br/>
	Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick.<br/>
	Throbbing of the other's heart: for Moses,<br/>
	He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent<br/>
	With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed<br/>
	Her full heart into her lips; but there was<br/>
	Firmness in the young man's choice, and he beat back<br/>
	The opposition of her lips with the calm<br/>
	Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak.<br/>
	<br/>
	MOSES.<br/>
	Gracious lady, thou remembrest well<br/>
	The Hebrew nurse to whom thou gavest thy foundling.<br/>
	That woman was my mother; from her lips I<br/>
	Learned the grand traditions of our race that float,<br/>
	With all their weird and solemn beauty, around<br/>
	Our wrecked and blighted fortunes. How oft!<br/>
	With kindling eye and glowing cheek, forgetful<br/>
	Of the present pain, she would lead us through<br/>
	The distant past: the past, hallowed by deeds<br/>
	Of holy faith and lofty sacrifice.<br/>
	How she would tell us of Abraham,<br/>
	The father of our race, that he dwelt in Ur;<br/>
	Of the Chaldees, and when the Chaldean king<br/>
	Had called him to his sacrifice, that he<br/>
	Had turned from his dumb idols to the living<br/>
	God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race,<br/>
	Led by his faith in God alone; and she would<br/>
	Tell us,—(we were three,) my brother Aaron,<br/>
	The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse,<br/>
	And I, her last, her loved and precious child;<br/>
	She would tell us that one day our father<br/>
	Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer<br/>
	Up in sacrifice the only son of his<br/>
	Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father's<br/>
	Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith,<br/>
	But he resolved to give his son to God<br/>
	As a burnt offering upon Moriah's mount;<br/>
	That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning<br/>
	Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand<br/>
	Harps, he heard a voice bidding him stay his hand,<br/>
	And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold<br/>
	Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through<br/>
	Its fearful test. And then she would tell us<br/>
	Of a promise, handed down from sire to son,<br/>
	That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped,<br/>
	Would break our chains, and bring to us a great<br/>
	Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace<br/>
	Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds<br/>
	Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets;<br/>
	And then she would lift her eyes unto the far<br/>
	Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs<br/>
	Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within<br/>
	That promised land; and now I feel the hour<br/>
	Draws near which brings deliverance to our race.<br/>
	<br/>
	PRINCESS.<br/>
	These are but the dreams of thy young fancy;<br/>
	I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard<br/>
	Of men who have waded through slaughter<br/>
	To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles<br/>
	Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men<br/>
	Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads<br/>
	That lay between them and a throne; but I<br/>
	Never heard of men resigning ease for toil,<br/>
	The splendor of a palace for the squalor<br/>
	Of a hut, and casting down a diadem<br/>
	To wear a servile badge.<br/>
	                                        Sadly she gazed<br/>
	Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty<br/>
	Faith and high resolves—the dark prophetic eyes<br/>
	Which seemed to look beyond the present pain<br/>
	Unto the future greatness of his race.<br/>
	As she stood before him in the warm<br/>
	Loveliness of her ripened womanhood,<br/>
	Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire,<br/>
	And the bright tropical blood sent its quick<br/>
	Flushes o’er the olive of her cheek, on which<br/>
	Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood.<br/>
	Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows<br/>
	O'er her face as she stood slowly crushing<br/>
	With unconscious hand the golden tassels<br/>
	Of her crimson robe. She had known life only<br/>
	By its brightness, and could not comprehend<br/>
	The grandeur of the young man's choice; but she<br/>
	Felt her admiration glow before the earnest<br/>
	Faith that tore their lives apart and led him<br/>
	To another destiny. She had hoped to see<br/>
	The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred<br/>
	Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat<br/>
	The throne of the proud Pharaoh's; but now her<br/>
	Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang<br/>
	Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted,<br/>
	She to brood in silence o'er her pain, and he<br/>
	To take his mission from the hands of God<br/>
	And lead his captive race to freedom.<br/>
	With silent lips but aching heart she bowed<br/>
	Her queenly head and let him pass, and he<br/>
	Went forth to share the fortune of his race,<br/>
	Esteeming that as better far than pleasures<br/>
	Bought by sin and gilded o'er with vice.<br/>
	And he had chosen well, for on his brow<br/>
	God poured the chrism of a holy work.<br/>
	And thus anointed he has stood a bright<br/>
	Ensample through the changing centuries of time.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHAPTER II.<br/>
	<br/>
	It was a great change from the splendor, light<br/>
	And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts<br/>
	Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage.<br/>
	                                                     As he passed<br/>
	Into the outer courts of that proud palace,<br/>
	He paused a moment just to gaze upon<br/>
	The scenes 'mid which his early life had passed—<br/>
	The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,<br/>
	The fountains tossing on the air their silver spray,—<br/>
	The statues breathing music soft and low<br/>
	To greet the first faint flushes of the morn,—<br/>
	The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur<br/>
	From their stony beds—the sphynxes gaunt and grim,<br/>
	With unsolved riddles on their lips—and all<br/>
	The bright creation's painters art and sculptors<br/>
	Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth,<br/>
	And dance, and revelry, and song had chased<br/>
	With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours.<br/>
	He was leaving all; but no regrets came<br/>
	Like a shadow o'er his mind, for he had felt<br/>
	The quickening of a higher life, as if his<br/>
	Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth;<br/>
	And yet there was a tender light in those<br/>
	Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes<br/>
	Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous<br/>
	Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled<br/>
	On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe,<br/>
	And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty<br/>
	Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on<br/>
	Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes,<br/>
	And gorgeous temples faded from his sight,<br/>
	And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view.<br/>
	There he saw the women of his race kneading<br/>
	Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham<br/>
	Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw<br/>
	The increasing pallor on his sisters cheek,<br/>
	The deepening shadows on his mother's brow,<br/>
	The restless light that glowed in Aaron's eye,<br/>
	As if a hidden fire were smouldering<br/>
	In his brain; and bending o'er his mother<br/>
	In a tender, loving way, he said, “Mother,<br/>
	I've come to share the fortunes of my race,—<br/>
	To dwell within these lowly huts,—to wear<br/>
	The badge of servitude and toil, and eat<br/>
	The bitter bread of penury and pain.”<br/>
	A sudden light beamed from his mother's eye,<br/>
	And she said, “How's this, my son? but yesterday<br/>
	Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen,<br/>
	Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun<br/>
	But dared not enter, only they had heard<br/>
	That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst<br/>
	Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed<br/>
	Thy knee to Egypt's vain and heathen worship;<br/>
	Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac,<br/>
	And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst<br/>
	Be engrafted in Pharaoh's regal line,<br/>
	And be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.<br/>
	When thy father Amram heard the cruel news<br/>
	He bowed his head upon his staff and wept.<br/>
	But I had stronger faith than that. By faith<br/>
	I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh<br/>
	Were searching 'mid our quivering heart strings,<br/>
	Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove<br/>
	The rushes of thine ark and laid thee 'mid<br/>
	The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw<br/>
	The answer to that faith when Pharaoh's daughter<br/>
	Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child<br/>
	For her; and by that faith sustained, I heard<br/>
	As idle words the cruel news that stabbed<br/>
	Thy father like a sword.”<br/>
	“The Hebrews did not hear aright; last week<br/>
	There was a great day in On, from Esoan’s gate<br/>
	Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords<br/>
	And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled;<br/>
	The temple of the sun was opened. Isis<br/>
	And Osiris were unveiled before the people;<br/>
	Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers;<br/>
	Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air;<br/>
	The sacrifice was smoking on the altar;<br/>
	The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables<br/>
	Of the sun: the music rose in lofty swells,<br/>
	Then sank in cadences so soft and low<br/>
	Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture.<br/>
	The priests of On were there, with sacred palms<br/>
	Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their<br/>
	Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting<br/>
	In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear<br/>
	Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear<br/>
	Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On<br/>
	Drew near to lay their hands upon my head<br/>
	And bid me swear, ‘Now, by Osiris, judge<br/>
	Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us<br/>
	All,' that henceforth I'd forswear my kindred,<br/>
	Tribe and race; would have no other gods<br/>
	Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted<br/>
	Into Pharaoh's royal line, and be called<br/>
	The son of Pharaoh's daughter. Then, mother<br/>
	Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat<br/>
	Beside thee, my lips apart with childish<br/>
	Wonder, my eager eyes uplifted to thy<br/>
	Glowing face, and my young soul gathering<br/>
	Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard<br/>
	Thee tell the grand traditions of our race,<br/>
	The blessed hopes and glorious promises<br/>
	That weave their golden threads among the sombre<br/>
	Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid<br/>
	The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again<br/>
	I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant<br/>
	Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom<br/>
	The promise came that in his seed should all<br/>
	The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac,<br/>
	Blessing with disappointed lips his first born son,<br/>
	From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob,<br/>
	With his warm affections and his devious ways,<br/>
	Flying berore the wrath of Esau; how he<br/>
	Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams<br/>
	A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God's<br/>
	Angels did descend, and waking, with a solemn<br/>
	Awe o'ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, 'How<br/>
	Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I<br/>
	Knew it not.' Of Joseph, once a mighty prince<br/>
	Within this land, who shrank in holy horror<br/>
	From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin;<br/>
	Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride<br/>
	Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race,<br/>
	And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord<br/>
	He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made<br/>
	His brethren swear that they would make his grave<br/>
	Among the patriarchs of his line, because<br/>
	Machpelah's cave, where Abraham bowed before<br/>
	The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay<br/>
	His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his<br/>
	Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid<br/>
	The princely dead of Egypt.<br/>
	          Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met<br/>
	Our father Jacob on his way, thy words<br/>
	Came back as messengers of light to guide<br/>
	My steps, and I refused to be called the son<br/>
	Of Pharaoh's daughter. I saw the priests of On<br/>
	Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping<br/>
	O'er the princess' face, while Pharaoh's brow grew<br/>
	Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I<br/>
	Endured, as seeing him who hides his face<br/>
	Behind the brightness of his glory.<br/>
	And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt<br/>
	To cast my lot among the people of my race.”<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	FLIGHT INTO MIDIAN.—CHAPTER III.<br/>
	<br/>
	The love of Moses for his race soon found<br/>
	A stern expression. Pharaoh was building<br/>
	A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud,<br/>
	He scrupled not at means to gain his ends.<br/>
	When he feared the growing power of Israel<br/>
	He stained his hands in children's blood, and held<br/>
	A carnival of death in Goshen; but now<br/>
	He wished to hand his name and memory<br/>
	Down unto the distant ages, and instead<br/>
	Of lading that memory with the precious<br/>
	Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he<br/>
	Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold<br/>
	Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold<br/>
	And hard, and heartless as himself.<br/>
	                                                  And Israel was<br/>
	The fated race to whom the cruel tasks<br/>
	Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong<br/>
	And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime,<br/>
	Came to the ear of Moses, and he said,<br/>
	These reports are ever harrowing my soul;<br/>
	I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh's<br/>
	Officers exact their labors, and see<br/>
	If these things be so—if they smite the feeble<br/>
	At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils<br/>
	Beyond their strength–if neither age nor sex<br/>
	Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods."<br/>
	And Moses went to see his brethren.<br/>
	                                                  'Twas eventide,<br/>
	And the laborers were wending their way<br/>
	Unto their lowly huts. 'Twas a sad sight,—<br/>
	The young girls walked without the bounding steps<br/>
	Of youth, with faces prematurely old,<br/>
	As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises<br/>
	Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish<br/>
	Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say,<br/>
	We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we've bent unto<br/>
	Our burdens until our shoulders fit them,<br/>
	And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude<br/>
	And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast<br/>
	In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes,<br/>
	Which seemed to say, to day we bide our time,<br/>
	And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only<br/>
	Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press<br/>
	Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh;<br/>
	They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride<br/>
	And insolence, watching the laborers<br/>
	Sadly wending their way from toil to rest.<br/>
	And Moses' heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly<br/>
	Musing, he sought a path that led him<br/>
	From the busy haunts of men. But even there<br/>
	The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard<br/>
	A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words,<br/>
	And, looking back, he saw an officer<br/>
	Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand<br/>
	An aged man. Then Moses' wrath o'erflowed<br/>
	His lips, and every nerve did tremble<br/>
	With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he<br/>
	Cried unto the smiter, “Stay thy hand; seest thou<br/>
	That aged man? His head is whiter than our<br/>
	Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy<br/>
	Bidding because thy cruel tasks have drained<br/>
	Away their strength.” The Egyptain raised his eyes<br/>
	With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute<br/>
	His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His<br/>
	Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he<br/>
	Waved a menace with his hand, saying, “back<br/>
	To thy task base slave, nor dare resist the will<br/>
	Of Pharaoh.” Then Moses' wrath o'erleaped the bounds<br/>
	Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled<br/>
	The smiter to the earth, and Israel had<br/>
	One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness<br/>
	Chase the flushes from the Egyptian's face,<br/>
	The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance,<br/>
	And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs ;<br/>
	And when he knew that he was dead, he hid<br/>
	Him in the sand and left him to his rest.<br/>
	                                                  Another day Moses walked<br/>
	Abroad, and saw two brethren striving<br/>
	For mastery; and then his heart grew full<br/>
	Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers<br/>
	Of a common wrong: should not their wrongs more<br/>
	Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division,<br/>
	Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, “ye<br/>
	Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?”<br/>
	But they threw back his words in angry tones<br/>
	And asked if he had come to judge them, and would<br/>
	Mete to them the fate of the Egyptian?<br/>
	Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep<br/>
	His secret, that his life no more was safe<br/>
	In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts<br/>
	Of Arabia and became a shepherd<br/>
	For the priest of Midian.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHAPTER IV.<br/>
	<br/>
	                    Men grow strong in action, but in solitude<br/>
	Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away<br/>
	The bridge on which he has walked in safety<br/>
	To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat<br/>
	To Pharaoh's throne, and did choose the calling<br/>
	Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became<br/>
	A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid<br/>
	The solitudes and wilds of Midian, where he<br/>
	Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith<br/>
	In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe<br/>
	And race. Years stole o'er him, but they took<br/>
	No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight<br/>
	Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face<br/>
	Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire<br/>
	That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened<br/>
	To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart<br/>
	Was just as faithful to his race as when he had<br/>
	Stood in Pharaoh's courts and bade farewell<br/>
	Unto his daughter.<br/>
	There was a look of patient waiting on his face,<br/>
	A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted<br/>
	Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face,<br/>
	The wings of some great destiny o'ershadowing<br/>
	All his life with strange and solemn glory.<br/>
	But the hour came when he must pass from thought<br/>
	To action,—when the hope of many years<br/>
	Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel's<br/>
	Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus:<br/>
	One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw<br/>
	A fertile spot skirted by desert sands,—<br/>
	A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip<br/>
	The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks;<br/>
	And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire<br/>
	Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame<br/>
	Sent up its jets and sprays of purest light,<br/>
	And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled,<br/>
	Was just as green and fresh as if the breath<br/>
	Of early spring were kissing every leaf.<br/>
	Then Moses said I'll turn aside to see<br/>
	This sight, and as he turned he heard a voice<br/>
	Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he<br/>
	Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head<br/>
	Upon his staff and spread his mantle о'er<br/>
	His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty<br/>
	Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot,<br/>
	By Horeb's mount, his shrinking hands received<br/>
	The burden of his God, which bade him go<br/>
	To Egypt's guilty king, and bid him let<br/>
	The oppressed go free.<br/>
	                                                  Commissioned thus<br/>
	He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought<br/>
	The tents of Jethro, and said "I pray thee<br/>
	Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;<br/>
	And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought<br/>
	To throw himself across the purpose of his soul.<br/>
	Yet there was a tender parting in that home;<br/>
	There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips,<br/>
	And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro<br/>
	And his daughters stood within the light of that and gave<br/>
	Clean morn, and gave to Moses and his wife<br/>
	And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells.<br/>
	For he had been a son and brother in that home<br/>
	Since first with manly courtesy he had filled<br/>
	The empty pails of Reuel's daughters, and found<br/>
	A shelter 'neath his tent when flying from<br/>
	The wrath of Pharaoh.<br/>
	                                                  They journeyed on,<br/>
	Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back<br/>
	With tender love upon the home she had left,<br/>
	With all its precious memories crowding round<br/>
	Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking<br/>
	His path across the desert, longing once more<br/>
	To see the long-lost faces of his distant home,<br/>
	The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their<br/>
	Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon<br/>
	His youthful head their parting blessing. They<br/>
	Journeyed on till morning's flush and noonday<br/>
	Splendor glided into the softened, mellowed<br/>
	Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep’ning<br/>
	On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual<br/>
	Crowned, arose before him; and there he met<br/>
	His brother Aaron, sent by God to be<br/>
	His spokesman and to bear him company<br/>
	To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting.<br/>
	They talked of home and friends until the lighter<br/>
	Ripple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed:<br/>
	And then they talked of Israel's bondage,<br/>
	And the great deliverance about to dawn<br/>
	Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses<br/>
	Told him of the burning bush, and how the message<br/>
	Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus<br/>
	They talked until the risen moon had veiled<br/>
	The mount in soft and silvery light; and then<br/>
	They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed<br/>
	From sleep, pursued their way until they reached<br/>
	The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders<br/>
	Of their race, and told them of the message<br/>
	Of their Father's God. Then eager lips caught up<br/>
	The words of hope and passed the joyful “news<br/>
	Around, and all the people bowed their heads<br/>
	And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness<br/>
	To God.”<br/>
	                                                  That same day<br/>
	Moses sought an audience with the king. He found<br/>
	Him on his throne surrounded by the princes<br/>
	Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage<br/>
	At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip<br/>
	And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew's God<br/>
	Then asked in cold and scornful tones, “Has<br/>
	Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt<br/>
	For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt<br/>
	I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has<br/>
	Overflowed her banks and filled the land<br/>
	With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto<br/>
	Their God, then crept in want and sorrow<br/>
	To their graves. Surely Mizraim's God is strong<br/>
	And Israel's is weak; then wherefore should<br/>
	I heed his voice, or at his bidding break<br/>
	A single yoke?” Thus reasoned that proud king,<br/>
	And turned a deafened ear unto the words<br/>
	Of Moses and bis brother, and yet he felt<br/>
	Strangely awed before their presence, because<br/>
	They stood as men who felt the grandeur<br/>
	Of their mission, and thought not of themselves,<br/>
	But of their message.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHAPTER V.<br/>
	<br/>
	On the next day Pharaoh called a council<br/>
	Of his mighty men, and before them laid<br/>
	The message of the brethren: then Amorphel,<br/>
	Keeper of the palace and nearest lord<br/>
	Unto the king, arose, and bending low<br/>
	Before the throne, craved leave to speak a word.<br/>
	Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man,<br/>
	With oily lips well versed in flattery<br/>
	And courtly speech, a supple reed ready<br/>
	To bend before his royal master's lightest<br/>
	Breath—Pharaoh's willing tool. He said<br/>
	“Gracious king, thou has been too lenient<br/>
	With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they<br/>
	Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle<br/>
	And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now<br/>
	If thou would'st have these people dwell in peace,<br/>
	Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto<br/>
	Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added<br/>
	Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition<br/>
	And revolt.”<br/>
	<br/>
	Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh's court,<br/>
	Arose. He was an aged man, whose white<br/>
	And heavy beard hung low upon his breast,<br/>
	Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye,<br/>
	And on his face a proud and evil look.<br/>
	He had been a servant to the former king,<br/>
	And wore his signet ring upon his hand.<br/>
	He said, “I know this Moses well. Fourscore<br/>
	Years ago Princess Charmian found him<br/>
	By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did<br/>
	Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all<br/>
	The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood<br/>
	Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood<br/>
	Within his veins, would rather be a servant<br/>
	Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand,<br/>
	He thrust aside the honors of our dear<br/>
	Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth,<br/>
	But for his daughter's sake he let the trespass<br/>
	Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian<br/>
	In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life;<br/>
	But be fled, it is said, unto the deserts<br/>
	Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest<br/>
	Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks<br/>
	And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race<br/>
	To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition<br/>
	And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee,<br/>
	That these men shall gather their own straw<br/>
	And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.”<br/>
	And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his<br/>
	Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh<br/>
	Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshen—<br/>
	That the laborers should gather their own straw,<br/>
	And yet they should not ʼminish of their tale of bricks.<br/>
	                                     'Twas a sad day in Goshen;<br/>
	The king's degree hung like a gloomy pall<br/>
	Around their homes. The people fainted 'neath<br/>
	Their added tasks, then cried unto the king,<br/>
	That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed<br/>
	A taunt into their ears and said, “ye are<br/>
	Idle, and your minds are filled with vain<br/>
	And foolish thoughts; get you into your tasks,<br/>
	And ye shall not ʼminish of your tale of bricks."<br/>
	                              And then they turned their eyes<br/>
	Reproachfully on Moses and his brother,<br/>
	And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders.<br/>
	'Tis an old story now, but then 'twas new<br/>
	Unto the brethren,—how God's anointed ones<br/>
	Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn<br/>
	To lines of living light; how hands that bring<br/>
	Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel<br/>
	Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth<br/>
	Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows<br/>
	Now bright beneath the aureola of God,<br/>
	Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth.<br/>
	                              There was hope for Israel,<br/>
	But they did not see the golden fringes<br/>
	Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold,<br/>
	Grey sky, and fainted 'neath the cheerless gloom.<br/>
	<br/>
	Moses sought again the presence of the king:<br/>
	And Pharaoh's brow grew dark with wrath,<br/>
	And rising up in angry haste, he said,<br/>
	Defiantly, "If thy God be great, show<br/>
	Us some sign or token of his power.”<br/>
	Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor,<br/>
	And it trembled with a sign of life;<br/>
	The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing<br/>
	Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green,<br/>
	And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful<br/>
	Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth<br/>
	From Moses' side, lay coiled and panting<br/>
	At the monarch's feet. With wonder open-eyed<br/>
	The king gazed on the changed rod, then called<br/>
	For his magicians—wily men, well versed<br/>
	In sinful lore—and bade them do the same.<br/>
	And they, leagued with the powers of night, did<br/>
	Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses'<br/>
	Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss<br/>
	and angry gulp, he swallowed the living things<br/>
	That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses<br/>
	Show that Israel's God had greater power<br/>
	Than those dark sons of night.<br/>
	                                        But not by this alone<br/>
	Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed<br/>
	Their waters; every fountain, well and pool<br/>
	Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst,<br/>
	Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts.<br/>
	And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life;<br/>
	Millions of frogs swarmed from the stream—they clogged<br/>
	The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred<br/>
	Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh's bed, and hopped<br/>
	Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his<br/>
	Ovens and his pans.<br/>
	<br/>
	Then came another plague, of loathsome vermin;<br/>
	They were gray and creeping things, that made<br/>
	Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre<br/>
	Spots—things so loathsome in the land they did<br/>
	Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest<br/>
	Dared to lift his hand to any god with one<br/>
	Of these upon him. And then the sky grew<br/>
	Dark, as if a cloud were passing o'er its<br/>
	Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o'er<br/>
	The city, and the land was swarmed with flies.<br/>
	The murrain laid their cattle low; the hail<br/>
	Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts,<br/>
	With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops,<br/>
	And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire<br/>
	Had scorched it through,<br/>
	                                                  Then angry blains<br/>
	And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man<br/>
	And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron<br/>
	Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light<br/>
	Divided day from morn, nor told the passage<br/>
	Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat<br/>
	In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a<br/>
	burden<br/>
	On the air,—a darkness one might almost gather<br/>
	In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came<br/>
	The last dread plague—the death of the first born.<br/>
	                                                  'Twas midnight,<br/>
	And a startling shriek rose from each palace,<br/>
	Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes<br/>
	Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense<br/>
	Of dread, as if the mystic angels wing<br/>
	Had chilled the very air with horror.<br/>
	Death! Death! was everywhere—in every home<br/>
	A corpse–in every heart a bitter woe.<br/>
	There were anxious fingerings for the pulse<br/>
	That ne'er would throb again, and eager listenings<br/>
	For some sound of life—a hurrying to and fro—<br/>
	Then burning kisses on the cold lips<br/>
	Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells,<br/>
	And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks,<br/>
	And deep and heavy groans throughout the length<br/>
	And breadth of Egypt. 'Twas the last dread plague,<br/>
	But it had snapped in twain the chains on which<br/>
	The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed;<br/>
	Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste<br/>
	From out the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed<br/>
	To see them gather up their flocks and herds,<br/>
	And household goods, and leave the land; because they felt<br/>
	That death stood at their doors as long as Israel<br/>
	Lingered there; and they went forth in haste,<br/>
	To tread the paths of freedom.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHAPTER VI.<br/>
	<br/>
	But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning<br/>
	From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt's wail<br/>
	Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had<br/>
	Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed<br/>
	Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped<br/>
	Near Baalzephn.<br/>
	Then Pharaoh said, “the wilderness will hem them in,<br/>
	The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front,<br/>
	And with my chariots and my warlike men<br/>
	I'll bring them back, or mete them out their graves."<br/>
	                                    Then Pharaoh's officers arose<br/>
	And gathered up the armies of the king,<br/>
	And made his chariots ready for pursuit.<br/>
	With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun,<br/>
	In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold,<br/>
	Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him<br/>
	Rode his mighty men, their banners floating<br/>
	On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering<br/>
	In the morning light; and Israel saw,<br/>
	With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their<br/>
	Track: then women wept in hopeless terror;<br/>
	Children hid their faces in their mothers' robes,<br/>
	And strong, men bowed 'their 'heads in agony and dread;<br/>
	And then a bitter, angry murmur rose,—<br/>
	"Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast<br/>
	Brought us here to die?”<br/>
	'Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow<br/>
	With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts<br/>
	Be strong and they should his salvation see.<br/>
	"Stand still," said Moses to the fearful throng<br/>
	Whose hearts were fainting in the wild,“ Stand still."<br/>
	Ah, that was Moses' word, but higher and greater<br/>
	Came God's watchword for the hour, and not for that<br/>
	Alone, but all the coming hours of time.<br/>
	"Speak ye unto the people and bid them<br/>
	Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters<br/>
	And smite them with thy rod.” And Moses smote<br/>
	The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps,<br/>
	Then lay as calm and still as lips that just<br/>
	Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea<br/>
	Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted<br/>
	Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people's<br/>
	Way was God's own wondrous masonry;<br/>
	The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild<br/>
	Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt's<br/>
	Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light<br/>
	To Israel's path. Madly rushed the hosts<br/>
	Of Pharaoh upon the people's track, when<br/>
	The solemn truth broke on them—that God<br/>
	For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror<br/>
	Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, “let<br/>
	Us flee,” they cried, “from Israel, for their God<br/>
	Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side."<br/>
	They had trusted in their chariots, but now<br/>
	That hope was vain; God had loosened every<br/>
	Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each<br/>
	Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still<br/>
	With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered<br/>
	And the thunder roared and muttered on the air,<br/>
	And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered<br/>
	O'er their heads, for the waves began to tremble<br/>
	And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose<br/>
	A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread,<br/>
	A gurgling sound of horror, as "the waves<br/>
	Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking<br/>
	Out their place again,"and the flower and pride<br/>
	Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea<br/>
	Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark<br/>
	Upon the shore, and the song of Israel's<br/>
	Triumph was the requiem of their foes.<br/>
	Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs<br/>
	And down the valleys, o'er the dark and restless<br/>
	Sea, rose the people's shout of triumph, going<br/>
	Up in praise to God, and the very air<br/>
	Seemed joyous, for the choral song of millions<br/>
	Throbbed upon its viewless wings.<br/>
	Then another song of triumph rose in accents<br/>
	Soft and clear; “'twas the voice of Moses' sister<br/>
	Rising in the tide of song. The warm blood<br/>
	Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins;<br/>
	The roses of her girlhood were flushing<br/>
	On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor<br/>
	Of long departed days, for time itself seemed<br/>
	Pausing, and she lived the past again; again<br/>
	The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream,<br/>
	A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay;<br/>
	The tender tide of rapture swept o'er her soul again<br/>
	She had felt when Pharaoh's daughter had claimed<br/>
	Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy<br/>
	Above her rescued son. Then again she saw<br/>
	Him choosing "’twixt Israel's pain and sorrow<br/>
	And Egypt's pomp and pride." But now he stood<br/>
	Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud<br/>
	She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women<br/>
	In music, dance and song, as they shouted out<br/>
	Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains.<br/>
	<br/>
	MIRIAM'S SONG<br/>
	A wail in the palace, a wail in the hut,<br/>
	          The midnight is shivering with dread,<br/>
	And Egypt wakes up with a shriek and a sob<br/>
	          To mourn for her first-born and dead.<br/>
	<br/>
	In the morning glad voices greeted the light,<br/>
	          As the Nile with its splendor was flushed;<br/>
	At midnight silence had melted their tones,<br/>
	          And their music forever is hushed.<br/>
	<br/>
	In the morning the princes of palace and court<br/>
	          To the heir of the kingdom bowed down;<br/>
	'Tis midnight, pallid and stark in his shroud<br/>
	          He dreams not of kingdom or crown.<br/>
	<br/>
	As a monument blasted and blighted by God,<br/>
	          Through the ages proud Pharaoh shall stand,<br/>
	All seamed with the vengeance and scarred with the wrath<br/>
	          That leaped from God's terrible hand.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHAPTER VII.<br/>
	<br/>
	They journeyed on from Zuphim's sea until<br/>
	They reached the sacred mount and heard the solemn<br/>
	Decalogue. The mount was robed in blackness,—<br/>
	Heavy and deep the shadows lay; the thunder<br/>
	Crashed and roared upon the air; the lightning<br/>
	Leaped from crag to crag; God's fearful splendor<br/>
	Flowed around, and Sinai quaked and shuddered<br/>
	To its base, and there did God proclaim<br/>
	Unto their listening ears, the great, the grand,<br/>
	The central and the primal truth of all<br/>
	The universe—the unity of God.<br/>
	                                         Only one God,—<br/>
	This truth received into the world's great life,<br/>
	Not as an idle dream nor speculative thing,<br/>
	But as a living, vitalizing thought,<br/>
	Should bind us closer to our God and link us<br/>
	With our fellow man, the brothers and co-heirs<br/>
	With Christ, the elder brother of our race.<br/>
	Before this truth let every blade of war<br/>
	Grow dull, and slavery, cowering at the light,<br/>
	Skulk from the homes of men; instead<br/>
	Of war bring peace and freedom, love and joy,<br/>
	And light for man, instead of bondage, whips<br/>
	And chains. Only one God! the strongest hands<br/>
	Should help the weak who bend before the blasts<br/>
	Of life, because if God is only one<br/>
	Then we are the children of his mighty hand,<br/>
	And when we best serve man, we also serve<br/>
	Our God. Let haughty rulers learn that men<br/>
	Of humblest birth and lowliest lot have<br/>
	Rights as sacred and divine as theirs, and they<br/>
	Who fence in leagues of earth by bonds and claims<br/>
	And title deeds, forgetting land and water,<br/>
	Air and light are God's own gifts and heritage<br/>
	For man—who throw their selfish lives between<br/>
	God's sunshine and the shivering poor—<br/>
	Have never learned the wondrous depth, nor scaled<br/>
	The glorious height of this great central truth,<br/>
	Around which clusters all the holiest faiths<br/>
	Of earth. The thunder died upon the air,<br/>
	The lightning ceased its livid play, the smoke<br/>
	And darkness died away in clouds, as soft<br/>
	And fair as summer wreaths that lie around<br/>
	The setting sun, and Sinai stood a bare<br/>
	And rugged thing among the sacred scenes<br/>
	Of earth.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
	<br/>
	It was a weary thing to bear the burden<br/>
	Of that restless and rebellious race. With<br/>
	Sinai's thunders almost crashing in their ears,<br/>
	They made a golden calf, and in the desert<br/>
	Spread an idol's feast, and sung the merry songs<br/>
	They had heard when Mizraim's songs bowed down before<br/>
	Their vain and heathen gods; and thus for many years<br/>
	Did Moses bear the evil manners of his race—<br/>
	Their angry murmurs, fierce regrets and strange<br/>
	Forgetfulness of God. Born slaves, they did not love<br/>
	The freedom of the wild more than their pots of flesh.<br/>
	And pleasant savory things once gathered<br/>
	From the gardens of the Nile.<br/>
	If slavery only laid its weight of chains<br/>
	Upon the weary, aching limbs, e'en then<br/>
	It were a curse; but when it frets through nerve<br/>
	And flesh and eats into the weary soul,<br/>
	Oh then it is a thing for every human<br/>
	Heart to loathe, and this was Israel's fate,<br/>
	For when the chains were shaken from their limbs,<br/>
	They failed to strike the impress from their souls.<br/>
	While he who'd basked beneath the radiance<br/>
	Of a throne, ne'er turned regretful eyes upon<br/>
	The past, nor sighed to grasp again the pleasures<br/>
	Once resigned; but the saddest trial was<br/>
	To see the light and joy fade from their faces<br/>
	When the faithless spies spread through their camp<br/>
	Their ill report; and when the people wept<br/>
	In hopeless unbelief and turned their faces<br/>
	Egyptward, and asked a captain from their bands<br/>
	To lead them back where they might bind anew<br/>
	Their broken chains, when God arose and shut<br/>
	The gates of promise on their lives, and left<br/>
	Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia's desert sands.<br/>
	But though they slumbered in the wild, they died<br/>
	With broader freedom on their lips, and for their<br/>
	Little ones did God reserve the heritage<br/>
	So rudely thrust aside.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	THE DEATH OF MOSES.—CHAPTER X.<br/>
	<br/>
	His work was done; his blessing lay<br/>
	Like precious ointment on his people's head,<br/>
	And God's great peace was resting on his soul.<br/>
	His life had been a lengthened sacrifice,<br/>
	A thing of deep devotion to his race,<br/>
	Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt's gild<br/>
	And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand<br/>
	And held them with a firm and constant grasp.<br/>
	But now his work was done; his charge was laid<br/>
	In Joshua's hand, and men of younger blood<br/>
	Were destined to possess the land and pass<br/>
	Through Jordan to the other side. He too<br/>
	Had hoped to enter there—to tread the soil<br/>
	Made sacred by the memories of his<br/>
	Kindred dead, and rest till life's calm close beneath<br/>
	The sheltering vines and stately palms of that<br/>
	Fair land; that hope had colored all his life's<br/>
	Young dreams and sent its mellowed flushes o'er<br/>
	His later years; but God's decree was otherwise.<br/>
	And so he bowed his meekened soul in calm<br/>
	Submission to the word, which bade him climb<br/>
	To Nebo's highest peak, and view the pleasant land<br/>
	From Jordan's swells unto the calmer ripples<br/>
	Of the tideless sea, then die with all its<br/>
	Loveliness in sight.<br/>
	As he passed from Moab's grassy vale to climb<br/>
	The rugged mount, the people stood in mournful groups,<br/>
	Some, with quivering lips and tearful eyes,<br/>
	Reaching out unconscious hands, as if to stay<br/>
	His steps and keep him ever at their side, while<br/>
	Others gazed with reverent awe upon<br/>
	The calm and solemn beauty on his aged brow,<br/>
	The look of loving trust and lofty faith<br/>
	Still beaming from an eye that neither care<br/>
	Nor time had dimmed. As he passed upward, tender<br/>
	Blessings, earnest prayers and sad farewells rose<br/>
	On each wave of air, then died in one sweet<br/>
	Murmur of regretful love; and Moses stood<br/>
	Alone on Nebo's mount.<br/>
	                                                       Alone! not one<br/>
	Of all that mighty throng who had trod with him<br/>
	In triumph through the parted food was there.<br/>
	Aaron had died in Hor, with son and brother<br/>
	By his side; and Miriam too was gone.<br/>
	But kindred hands had made her grave, and Kadesh<br/>
	Held her dust. But he was all alone; nor wife<br/>
	Nor child was there to clasp in death his hand,<br/>
	And bind around their bleeding hearts the precious<br/>
	Parting words. And yet he was not all alone,<br/>
	For God's great presence flowed around his path<br/>
	And stayed him in that solemn hour.<br/>
	<br/>
	          He stood upon the highest peak of Nebo,<br/>
	And saw the Jordan chafing through its gorges,<br/>
	Its banks made bright by scarlet blooms<br/>
	And purple blossoms. The placid lakes<br/>
	And emerald meadows, the snowy crest<br/>
	Of distant mountains, the ancient rocks<br/>
	That dripped with honey, the hills all bathed<br/>
	In light and beauty; the shady groves<br/>
	And peaceful vistas, the vines opprest<br/>
	With purple riches, the fig trees fruit-crowned<br/>
	Green and golden, the pomegranates with crimson<br/>
	Blushes, the olives with their darker clusters,<br/>
	Rose before him like a vision, full of beauty<br/>
	And delight. Gazed he on the lovely landscape<br/>
	Till it faded from his view, and the wing<br/>
	Of death's sweet angel hovered o'er the mountain's<br/>
	Crest, and he heard his garments rustle through<br/>
	The watches of the night.<br/>
	                                   Then another, fairer, vision<br/>
	Broke upon his longing gaze; 'twas the land<br/>
	Of crystal fountains, love and beauty, joy<br/>
	And light, for the pearly gates flew open,<br/>
	And his ransomed soul went in. And when morning<br/>
	O'er the mountain fringed each crag and peak with light,<br/>
	Cold and lifeless lay the leader. God had touched<br/>
	His eyes with slumber, giving his beloved sleep.<br/>
	                    Oh never on that mountain<br/>
	                    Was seen a lovelier sight<br/>
	                    Than the troupe of fair young angels<br/>
	                    That gathered 'round the dead.<br/>
	                    With gentle hands they bore bim,<br/>
	                    That bright and shining train,<br/>
	                    From Nebo's lonely mountain<br/>
	                    To sleep in Moab's vale.<br/>
	                    But they sung no mornful dirges,<br/>
	                    No solemn requiems said,<br/>
	                    And the soft wave of their pinions<br/>
	                    Made music as they trod.<br/>
	                    But no one heard them passing,<br/>
	                    None saw their chosen grave;<br/>
	                    It was the angels secret<br/>
	                    Where Moses should be laid.<br/>
	                    And when the grave was finished,<br/>
	                    They trod with golden sandals<br/>
	                    Above the sacred spot,<br/>
	                    And the brightest, fairest flowers<br/>
	                    Sprang up beneath their tread.<br/>
	                    Nor broken turf, nor hillock<br/>
	                    Did e'er reveal that grave,<br/>
	                    And truthful lips have never said<br/>
	                    We know where he is laid.<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Ragged Stocking</h2>
	 Do you see this ragged stocking,<br/>
	    Here a rent and there a hole?<br/>
	 Each thread of this little stocking<br/>
	    Is woven around my soul.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Do you wish to hear my story?<br/>
	   Excuse me, the tears will start.<br/>
	 For the sight of this ragged stocking<br/>
	   Stirs the fountains of my heart.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 You say that my home is happy ;<br/>
	   To me 'tis earth's fairest place,<br/>
	 But its sunshine, peace and gladness<br/>
	   Back to this stocking I trace.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 I was once a wretched drunkard ;<br/>
	   Ah! you start and say not so ;<br/>
	 But the dreadful depths I've sounded,<br/>
	   And I speak of what I know.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 I was wild and very reckless<br/>
	   When I stood on manhood's brink,<br/>
	 And, joining with pleasure-seekers<br/>
	   Learned to revel and drink.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Strong drink is a raging demon,<br/>
	   In his hands are shame and woe ;<br/>
	 He mocketh the strength of the mighty<br/>
	   And bringeth the strong man low.<br/>
	  <br/>
	 The light of my home was darkened<br/>
	   By the shadow of my sin;<br/>
	 And want and woe unbarr'd the door,<br/>
	   And suffering entered in.<br/>
	<br/>
	* * * * * * * * * *<br/>
	 The streets were full one Cin-istmas eve,<br/>
	   And alive with girls and boys,<br/>
	 Merrily looking through window-panes<br/>
	   At bright and beautiful toys.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And throngs of parents came to buy<br/>
	   The gifts that children prize,<br/>
	 And homeward trudged with happy hearts,<br/>
	   The love-light in their eyes.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 I thought of my little Charley<br/>
	   At home in his lowly bed,<br/>
	 With the shadows around his life,<br/>
	   And in shame I bowed my head.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 I entered my home a sober man,<br/>
	   My heart by remorse was wrung,<br/>
	 And there in the chimney corner,<br/>
	   This little stocking was hung.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Faded and worn as you see it ;<br/>
	   To me 'tis a precious thing.<br/>
	 And I never gaze upon it<br/>
	   But unbidden tears will spring.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 I began to search my pockets,<br/>
	   But scarcely a dime was there;<br/>
	 But scanty as was the pittance,<br/>
	   This stocking received its share.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 For a longing seized upon me<br/>
	   To gladden the heart of my boy.<br/>
	 And I bought him some cakes and candy,<br/>
	   And added a simple toy.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Then I knelt by this little stocking<br/>
	   And sobbed out an earnest prayer,<br/>
	 And arose with strength to wrestle<br/>
	   And break from the tempter's snare.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And this faded, worn-out stocking,<br/>
	   So pitiful once to see,<br/>
	 Became the wedge that broke my chain,<br/>
	   And a blessing brought to me.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Do you marvel then I prize it?<br/>
	   When each darn and seam and liole<br/>
	 Is linked with my soul's deliverance<br/>
	   From the bondage of the bowl ?<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And to night my wife will tell you.<br/>
	   Though I've houses, gold and land,<br/>
	 He holds no treasure more precious<br/>
	   Than this stocking in my hand.<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Fatal Pledge</h2>
	 "Pledge me with wine/' the maiden cried,<br/>
	    Her tones were gay and light ;<br/>
	 "From others you have turned aside,<br/>
	   I claim your pledge to-night."<br/>
	 <br/>
	 The blood rushed to the young man's cheek<br/>
	   Then left it deadly pale;<br/>
	 Beneath the witchery of her smile<br/>
	   He felt his courage fail.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 For many years he'd been a slave<br/>
	   To the enchanting bowl,<br/>
	 Until he grasped with eager hands<br/>
	   The reins of self-control ;<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And struggled with his hated thrall,<br/>
	   Until he rent his chain,<br/>
	 And strove to stand erect and free,<br/>
	   And be a man again.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 When others came with tempting words<br/>
	   He coldly turned aside.<br/>
	 But she who held the sparkling cup<br/>
	   Was his affianced bride ;<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And like a vision of delight.<br/>
	   Bright, beautiful and fair,<br/>
	 With thoughtless words she wove for him<br/>
	   The meshes of despair.<br/>
	  <br/>
	 From jeweled hands he took the cup,<br/>
	   Nor heard the serpent's hiss ;<br/>
	 Nor saw beneath its ruby glow<br/>
	   The deadly adder's hiss.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Like waves that madly, wildly dash,<br/>
	   When dykes are overthrown.<br/>
	 The barriers of his soul gave way,<br/>
	   Each life with wrecks was strewn.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And she who might have reached her hand<br/>
	   To succor and to save,<br/>
	 Soon wept in hopeless agony<br/>
	   Above a drunkard's grave.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And bore through life with bleeding heart<br/>
	   Remembrance of that night,<br/>
	 When she had urged the tempted man<br/>

	 It was done, the deed of horror ;<br/>
	   Christ had died upon the cross.<br/>
	 And within an upper chamber<br/>
	   The disciples mourned their loss.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Peter's eyes were full of anguish,<br/>
	   Thinking sadly of the trial<br/>
	 When his boasted self-reliance<br/>
	   Ended in his Lord's deniaL<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Disappointment, deep and heavy.<br/>
	   Shrouded every heart with gloom,<br/>
	 As the hopes so fondly cherished<br/>
	    Died around the garden tomb.<br/>
	   <br/>
	 And they thought with shame and sorrow<br/>
	   How they fled in that dark hour,<br/>
	 When they saw tlieir Lord and Master<br/>
	   In the clutch of Roman power.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 We had hoped, they sadly uttered,<br/>
	   He would over Israel reign,<br/>
	 But to-day he lies sepulchred.<br/>
	   And our cherished hopes are vain.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 In the humble home of Mary<br/>
	   Slowly waned the hours away,<br/>
	 Till she rose to seek the garden<br/>
	   And the place where Jesus lay.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Not the cross with all its anguish<br/>
	   Could her loving heart restrain,<br/>
	 But the tomb she sought was empty,<br/>
	   And her heart o'erflowed with pain.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 To embalm my Lord and Master<br/>
	   To this garden I have strayed.<br/>
	 But, behold, I miss his body.<br/>
	   And I know not where he's laid.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Then a wave of strange emotion<br/>
	   Swept her soul, as angels said,<br/>
	 "Wherefore do ye seek the living<br/>
	   'Mid the chambers of the dead? "<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Unperceived, her Lord stood by her,<br/>
	   Silent witness of her grief,<br/>
	 Bearing on his lips the tidings<br/>
	   Sure to bring a glad relief<br/>
	 <br/>
	 But her tear-dimmed eyes were holden<br/>
	   When she heard the Master speak ;<br/>
	 Til ought she, only 'tis the gardener<br/>
	   Asking whom her soul did seek.<br/>
	<br/>
	 Then a sudden flush of gladness<br/>
	   O'er her grief- worn features spread;<br/>
	 When she knew the voice of Jesus<br/>
	   All her bitter anguish fled.<br/>
	 <br/>
	Forth she reached hands in rapture.<br/>
	  Touch me not, the Saviour said ;<br/>
	Take the message to my brethren,<br/>
	  I have risen from the dead.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Take them words of joy and comfort,<br/>
	    Which will all their mourning end;<br/>

	 "Brethren, I have seen the Master:<br/>

	 But like words of idle meaning<br/>
	   Seemed the glorious words she said.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Soon they saw the revelation<br/>
	   Which would bid their mourning cease;<br/>
	 Christ, the risen, stood before them<br/>
	   Breathing words of love and peace.<br/>

	 And for his sake from pride and scorn<br/>
	   Our spirits shall be free,<br/>
	 Till through our souls shall sound the words<br/>
	    He did it unto me.<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Deliverance</h2>
	 Rise up! rise up! Oh Israel,<br/>
	   Let a spotless lamb be slain;<br/>
	 The angel of death will o'er you bend<br/>
	   And rend your galling chain.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Sprinkle its blood upon the posts<br/>
	   And lintels of your door ;<br/>
	 When the angel sees the crimson spots<br/>
	   Unharmed he will pass you o'er.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Gather your flocks and herds to-night,<br/>
	 Your children by  our side :<br/>
	 A leader from Arabia comes<br/>
	 To be your friend and guide.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 With girded loins and sandlcd feet<br/>
	   Await the hour of dread,<br/>
	 When Mizraim shall wildly mourn<br/>
	   Her first-born and her dead.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 The sons of Abraham no more<br/>
	    Shall crouch 'neath Pliaroah's hand,<br/>
	 Trembling with agony and dread,<br/>
	   He'll thrust you from the land.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And ye shall hold in unborn years<br/>
	   A feast to mark this day,<br/>
	 When joyfully the fathers rose<br/>
	   And cast their chains away.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 When crimson tints of morning flush<br/>
	   The golden gates of day,<br/>
	 Or gorgeous hue of even melt<br/>
	   In sombre shades away,<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Then ye shall to your children teach<br/>
	   The meaning of this feast.<br/>
	 How from the proud oppressor's hand<br/>
	    Their fathers were released,<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And ye shall hold through distant years<br/>
	   This feast with glad accord,<br/>
	 And children's children yet shall learn<br/>
	   To love and trust the Lord.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Ages have passed since Israel trod<br/>
	   In triumph through the sea,<br/>
	 And yet they hold in memory's urn<br/>
	   Their first great jubilee.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 When Moses led the ransomed hosts,<br/>
	   And Miriam's song arose.<br/>
	 While ruin closed around the path<br/>
	   Of their pursuing foes.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Shall Israel thro' long varied years<br/>
	   These memories cherish yet,<br/>
	And we who lately stood redeemed<br/>
	   Our broken chains forget?<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Should we forget the wondrous change<br/>
	   That to our people came,<br/>
	 When justice rose and sternly plead<br/>
	   Our cause with sword and flame ?<br/>
	 <br/>
	 And led us through the storms of war<br/>
	   To freedom's fairer shore,<br/>
	 When slavery sank beneath a flood<br/>
	   Whose waves were human gore.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Oh, youth and maidens of the land,<br/>
	   Rise up with one accord,<br/>
	 And in the name of Christ go forth<br/>
	   To battle for the Lord.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Go forth, but not in crimson fields.<br/>
	   With fratricidal strife,<br/>
	 But in the name of Christ go forth<br/>
	   For freedom, love and life.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Go forth to follow in his steps,<br/>
	   Who came not to destro}''.<br/>
	 Till wastes shall blossom as the rose,<br/>
	   And deserts sing for joy.<br/>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Simon's Feast</h2>
	 He is coming, she said, to Simon's feast.<br/>
	   The prophet of Galilee,<br/>
	 Though multitudes around him throng<br/>
	   In longing his face to see.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 He enters the home as Simon's guest,<br/>
	   But he gives no welcome kiss ;<br/>
	 He brings no water to bathe his feet —<br/>
	   Why is Simon so remiss ?<br/>
	 <br/>
	 The prophet's face is bright with love,<br/>
	   And mercy beams from his eye ;<br/>
	 He pities the poor, the lame and blind,<br/>
	   An outcast, I will draw nigh.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 If a prophet, he will surely know<br/>
	   The guilt of my darkened years ;<br/>
	 With broken heart I'll seek his face,<br/>
	   And bathe his feet with my tears.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 No holy rabbi lays his hand<br/>
	   In blessing on my head ;<br/>
	 No loving voice floats o'er the path,<br/>
	   The downward path I tread.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Unto the Master's side she pressed,<br/>
	   A penitent, frail and fair,<br/>
	 Rained on his feet a flood of tears.<br/>
	   And then wiped them with her hair.<br/>
	  <br/>
	 Over the face of Simon swept<br/>
	    An air of puzzled surprise ;<br/>
	 Can my guest a holy prophet be,<br/>
	   And not this woman despise?<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Christ saw the thoughts that Simon's heart<br/>
	   Had written upon his face,<br/>
	 Kindly turned to the sinful one<br/>
	   In her sorrow and disgrace.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Where Simon only saw the stains,<br/>
	   Where sin and shame were rife,<br/>
	 Christ looked beneath and saw the germs<br/>
	   Of a fair, outflowering life.<br/>
	 <br/>
	 Like one who breaks a galling chain,<br/>
	   And sets a prisoner free,<br/>
	 He rent her fetters with the words,<br/>
	   ''Thy sins are forgiven thee."<br/>
	 <br/>
	 God be praised for the gracious words<br/>
	   Which came through that woman's touch<br/>
	 That souls redeemed thro' God's dear Son<br/>
	   May learn to love him so much ;<br/>
	 <br/>
	 That souls once red with guilt and crime<br/>
	   May their crimson stains outgrow ;<br/>
	 The scarlet spots upon their lives<br/>
	   Become whiter than driven snow.<br/>
