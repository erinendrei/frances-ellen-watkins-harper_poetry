v#Kind and gracious princess, more than friend,
v#I've come to thank thee for thy goodness,
v#And to breathe into thy generous ears
v#My last and sad farewell. I go to join
v#The fortunes of my race, and to put aside
v#All other bright advantages, save
v#The approval of my conscience and the meed
v#Of rightly doing.

v#What means, my son, this strange election?
v#What wild chimera floats across thy mind?
v#What sudden impulse moves thy soul? Thou who
v#Hast only trod the court of kings, why seek
v#Instead the paths of labor? Thou, whose limbs
v#Have known no other garb than that which well
v#Befits our kingly state, why rather choose
v#The badge of servitude and toil?

v#Let me tell thee, gracious princess; 'tis no
v#Sudden freak nor impulse wild that moves my mind.
v#I feel an earnest purpose binding all
v#My soul unto a strong resolve, which bids
v#Me put aside all other ends and aims,
v#Until the hour shall come when God—the God
v#Our fathers loved and worshipped—shall break our chains,
v#And lead our willing feet to freedom.

v#Listen to me, Moses: thou art young,
v#And the warm blood of youth flushes thy veins
v#Like generous wine; thou wearest thy manhood
v#Like a crown; but what king e'er cast
v#His diadem in the dust, to be trampled
v#Down by every careless foot? Thou hast
v#Bright dreams and glowing hopes; could’st thou not live
v#Them out as well beneath the radiance
v#Of our throne as in the shadow of those
v#Bondage-darkened huts?

					<p>
v#Within those darkened huts my mother plies her tasks,
v#My father bends to unrequited toil;
v#And bitter tears moisten the bread my brethren eat.
v#And when I gaze upon their cruel wrongs
v#The very purple on my limbs seems drenched
v#With blood, the warm blood of my own kindred race;
v#And then thy richest viands pall upon my taste,
v#And discord jars in every tone of song.
v#I cannot live in pleasure while they faint
v#In pain.

v#How like a dream the past floats back: it seems
v#But yesterday when I lay tossing upon
v#My couch of pain, a torpor creeping through
v#Each nerve, a fever coursing through my veins.
v#And there I lay, dreaming of lilies fair,
v#Of lotus flowers and past delights, and all
v#The bright, glad hopes, that give to early life
v#Its glow and flush; and thus day after day
v#Dragged its slow length along, until, one morn,
v#The breath of lilies, fainting on the air,
v#Floated into my room, and then I longed once more
v#To gaze upon the Nile, as on the face
v#Of a familiar friend, whose absence long
v#Had made a mournful void within the heart.
v#I summoned to my side my maids, and bade
v#Them place my sandals on my feet, and lead
v#Me to the Nile, where I might bathe my weary
v#Limbs within the cooling flood, and gather
v#Healing from the sacred stream.
v#I sought my favorite haunt, and, bathing, found
v#New tides of vigor coursing through my veins.
v#Refreshed, I sat me down to weave a crown of lotus leaves
v#And lilies fair, and while I sat in a sweet
v#Revery, dreaming of life and hope, I saw
v#A little wicker-basket hidden among
v#The flags and lilies of the Nile, and I called
v#My maidens and said, “Nillias and Osiria
v#Bring me that little ark which floats beside
v#The stream.” They ran and brought me a precious burden.
v#'Twas an ark woven with rushes and daubed
v#With slime, and in it lay a sleeping child;
v#His little hand amid his clustering curls,
v#And a bright flush upon his glowing cheek.
v#He wakened with a smile, and reached out his hand
v#To meet the welcome of the mother's kiss,
v#When strange faces met his gaze, and he drew back
v#With a grieved, wondering look, while disappointment
v#Shook the quivering lip that missed the mother's
v#Wonted kiss, and the babe lifted his voice and wept.
v#Then my heart yearned towards him, and I resolved
v#That I would brave my father's wrath and save
v#The child; but while I stood gazing upon
v#His wondrous beauty, I saw beside
v#A Hebrew girl, her eyes bent on me
v#With an eager, questioning look, and drawing
v#Near, she timidly said, “shall I call a nurse?”
v#I bade her go; she soon returned, and with her
v#Came a woman of the Hebrew race, whose
v#Sad, sweet, serious eyes seemed overflowing
v#With a strange and sudden joy. I placed the babe
v#Within her arms and said, “Nurse this child for me;"
v#And the babe nestled there like one at home,
v#While o'er the dimples of his face rippled
v#The brightest, sweetest smiles, and I was well
v#Content to leave him in her care; and well
v#Did she perform her part. When many days had
v#Passed she brought the child unto the palace;
v#And one morning, while I sat toying with
v#His curls and listening to the prattle of his
v#Untrained lips, my father, proud and stately,
v#Saw me bending o’er the child and said,
v#“Charmain, whose child is this? who of my lords
v#Calls himself father to this goodly child?
v#He surely must be a happy man.”
v#Then I said, “Father, he is mine. He is a
v#Hebrew child that I have saved from death." He
v#Suddenly recoiled, as if an adder
v#Had stung him, and said, "Charmian, take that
v#Child hence. How darest thou bring a member
v#Of that mean and servile race within my doors?
v#Nay, rather let me send for Nechos, whose
v#Ready sword shall rid me of his hateful presence.
v#Then kneeling at his feet, and catching
v#Hold of his royal robes, I said, “Not so,
v#Oh! honored father, he is mine; I snatched
v#Him from the hungry jaws of death, and foiled
v#The greedy crocodile of his prey; he has
v#Eaten bread within thy palace walls, and thy
v#Salt lies upon his fresh young lips; he has
v#A claim upon thy mercy.”
v#“Charmian," he said,
v#“I have decreed that every man child of that
v#Hated race shall die. The oracles have said
v#The pyramids shall wane before their shadow,
v#And from them a star shall rise whose light shall
v#Spread over earth a baleful glow; and this is why
v#I root them from the land; their strength is weakness
v#To my throne. I shut them from the light lest they
v#Bring darkness to my kingdom. Now, Charmian,
v#Give me up the child, and let him die.”
v#Then clasping the child closer to my heart,
v#I said, "the pathway to his life is through my own;
v#Around that life I throw my heart, a wall
v#Of living, loving clay.” Dark as the thunder
v#Clouds of distant lands became my father's brow,
v#And his eyes flashed with the fierce lightnings
v#Of his wrath; but while I plead, with eager
v#Eyes upturned, I saw a sudden change come
v#Over him; his eyes beamed with unwonted
v#Tenderness, and he said, “Charmian, arise,
v#Thy prayer is granted; just then thy dead mother
v#Came to thine eyes, and the light of Asenath
v#Broke over thy face. Asenath was the light
v#Of my home; the star that faded out too
v#Suddenly from my dwelling, and left my life
v#To darkness, grief and pain, and for her sake,
v#Not thine, I'll spare the child.” And thus I saved
v#Thee twice-once from the angry sword and once
v#From the devouring flood. Moses, thou art
v#Doubly mine; as such I claimed thee then, as such
v#I claim thee now. I've nursed no other child
v#Upon my knee, and pressed upon no other
v#Lips the sweetest kisses of my love, and now,
v#With rash and careless hand, thou dost thrust aside that love.
v#There was a painful silence, a silence
v#So hushed and still that you might have almost
v#Heard the hurried breathing of one and the quick.
v#Throbbing of the other's heart: for Moses,
v#He was slow of speech, but she was eloquent
v#With words of tenderness and love, and had breathed
v#Her full heart into her lips; but there was
v#Firmness in the young man's choice, and he beat back
v#The opposition of her lips with the calm
v#Grandeur of his will, and again he essayed to speak.

v#Gracious lady, thou remembrest well
v#The Hebrew nurse to whom thou gavest thy foundling.
v#That woman was my mother; from her lips I
v#Learned the grand traditions of our race that float,
v#With all their weird and solemn beauty, around
v#Our wrecked and blighted fortunes. How oft!
v#With kindling eye and glowing cheek, forgetful
v#Of the present pain, she would lead us through
v#The distant past: the past, hallowed by deeds
v#Of holy faith and lofty sacrifice.
v#How she would tell us of Abraham,
v#The father of our race, that he dwelt in Ur;
v#Of the Chaldees, and when the Chaldean king
v#Had called him to his sacrifice, that he
v#Had turned from his dumb idols to the living
v#God, and wandered out from kindred, home and race,
v#Led by his faith in God alone; and she would
v#Tell us,—(we were three,) my brother Aaron,
v#The Hebrew girl thou sentest to call a nurse,
v#And I, her last, her loved and precious child;
v#She would tell us that one day our father
v#Abraham heard a voice, bidding him offer
v#Up in sacrifice the only son of his
v#Beautiful and beloved Sarah; that the father's
v#Heart shrank not before the bitter test of faith,
v#But he resolved to give his son to God
v#As a burnt offering upon Moriah's mount;
v#That the uplifted knife glittered in the morning
v#Sun, when, sweeter than the music of a thousand
v#Harps, he heard a voice bidding him stay his hand,
v#And spare the child; and how his faith, like gold
v#Tried in the fiercest fire, shone brighter through
v#Its fearful test. And then she would tell us
v#Of a promise, handed down from sire to son,
v#That God, the God our fathers loved and worshiped,
v#Would break our chains, and bring to us a great
v#Deliverance; that we should dwell in peace
v#Beneath our vines and palms, our flocks and herds
v#Increase, and joyful children crowd our streets;
v#And then she would lift her eyes unto the far
v#Off hills and tell us of the patriarchs
v#Of our line, who sleep in distant graves within
v#That promised land; and now I feel the hour
v#Draws near which brings deliverance to our race.

v#These are but the dreams of thy young fancy;
v#I cannot comprehend thy choice. I have heard
v#Of men who have waded through slaughter
v#To a throne; of proud ambitions, struggles
v#Fierce and wild for some imagined good; of men
v#Who have even cut in twain the crimson threads
v#That lay between them and a throne; but I
v#Never heard of men resigning ease for toil,
v#The splendor of a palace for the squalor
v#Of a hut, and casting down a diadem
v#To wear a servile badge.
v#Sadly she gazed
v#Upon the fair young face lit with its lofty
v#Faith and high resolves—the dark prophetic eyes
v#Which seemed to look beyond the present pain
v#Unto the future greatness of his race.
v#As she stood before him in the warm
v#Loveliness of her ripened womanhood,
v#Her languid eyes glowed with unwonted fire,
v#And the bright tropical blood sent its quick
v#Flushes o’er the olive of her cheek, on which
v#Still lay the lingering roses of her girlhood.
v#Grief, wonder, and surprise flickered like shadows
v#O'er her face as she stood slowly crushing
v#With unconscious hand the golden tassels
v#Of her crimson robe. She had known life only
v#By its brightness, and could not comprehend
v#The grandeur of the young man's choice; but she
v#Felt her admiration glow before the earnest
v#Faith that tore their lives apart and led him
v#To another destiny. She had hoped to see
v#The crown of Egypt on his brow, the sacred
v#Leopard skin adorn his shoulders, and his seat
v#The throne of the proud Pharaoh's; but now her
v#Dream had faded out and left a bitter pang
v#Of anguish in its stead. And thus they parted,
v#She to brood in silence o'er her pain, and he
v#To take his mission from the hands of God
v#And lead his captive race to freedom.
v#With silent lips but aching heart she bowed
v#Her queenly head and let him pass, and he
v#Went forth to share the fortune of his race,
v#Esteeming that as better far than pleasures
v#Bought by sin and gilded o'er with vice.
v#And he had chosen well, for on his brow
v#God poured the chrism of a holy work.
v#And thus anointed he has stood a bright
v#Ensample through the changing centuries of time.

v#It was a great change from the splendor, light
v#And pleasure of a palace to the lowly huts
v#Of those who sighed because of cruel bondage.
v#As he passed
v#Into the outer courts of that proud palace,
v#He paused a moment just to gaze upon
v#The scenes 'mid which his early life had passed—
v#The pleasant haunts amid the fairest flowers,
v#The fountains tossing on the air their silver spray,—
v#The statues breathing music soft and low
v#To greet the first faint flushes of the morn,—
v#The obelisks that rose in lofty grandeur
v#From their stony beds—the sphynxes gaunt and grim,
v#With unsolved riddles on their lips—and all
v#The bright creation's painters art and sculptors
v#Skill had gathered in those regal halls, where mirth,
v#And dance, and revelry, and song had chased
v#With careless feet the bright and fleeting hours.
v#He was leaving all; but no regrets came
v#Like a shadow o'er his mind, for he had felt
v#The quickening of a higher life, as if his
v#Soul had wings and he were conscious of their growth;
v#And yet there was a tender light in those
v#Dark eyes which looked their parting on the scenes
v#Of beauty, where his life had been a joyous
v#Dream enchanted with delight; but he trampled
v#On each vain regret as on a vanquished foe,
v#And went forth a strong man, girded with lofty
v#Purposes and earnest faith. He journeyed on
v#Till palaces and domes and lofty fanes,
v#And gorgeous temples faded from his sight,
v#And the lowly homes of Goshen came in view.
v#There he saw the women of his race kneading
v#Their tale of bricks; the sons of Abraham
v#Crouching beneath their heavy burdens. He saw
v#The increasing pallor on his sisters cheek,
v#The deepening shadows on his mother's brow,
v#The restless light that glowed in Aaron's eye,
v#As if a hidden fire were smouldering
v#In his brain; and bending o'er his mother
v#In a tender, loving way, he said, “Mother,
v#I've come to share the fortunes of my race,—
v#To dwell within these lowly huts,—to wear
v#The badge of servitude and toil, and eat
v#The bitter bread of penury and pain.”
v#A sudden light beamed from his mother's eye,
v#And she said, “How's this, my son? but yesterday
v#Two Hebrews, journeying from On to Goshen,
v#Told us they had passed the temple of the Sun
v#But dared not enter, only they had heard
v#That it was a great day in On; that thou hadst
v#Forsworn thy kindred, tribe and race; hadst bowed
v#Thy knee to Egypt's vain and heathen worship;
v#Hadst denied the God of Abraham, of Isaac,
v#And of Jacob, and from henceforth wouldst
v#Be engrafted in Pharaoh's regal line,
v#And be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
v#When thy father Amram heard the cruel news
v#He bowed his head upon his staff and wept.
v#But I had stronger faith than that. By faith
v#I hid thee when the bloody hands of Pharaoh
v#Were searching 'mid our quivering heart strings,
v#Dooming our sons to death; by faith I wove
v#The rushes of thine ark and laid thee 'mid
v#The flags and lilies of the Nile, and saw
v#The answer to that faith when Pharaoh's daughter
v#Placed thee in my arms, and bade me nurse the child
v#For her; and by that faith sustained, I heard
v#As idle words the cruel news that stabbed
v#Thy father like a sword.”
v#“The Hebrews did not hear aright; last week
v#There was a great day in On, from Esoan’s gate
v#Unto the mighty sea; the princes, lords
v#And chamberlains of Egypt were assembled;
v#The temple of the sun was opened. Isis
v#And Osiris were unveiled before the people;
v#Apis and Orus were crowned with flowers;
v#Golden censers breathed their fragrance on the air;
v#The sacrifice was smoking on the altar;
v#The first fruits of the Nile lay on the tables
v#Of the sun: the music rose in lofty swells,
v#Then sank in cadences so soft and low
v#Till all the air grew tremulous with rapture.
v#The priests of On were there, with sacred palms
v#Within their hands and lotus leaves upon their
v#Brows; Pharaoh and his daughter sat waiting
v#In their regal chairs; all were ready to hear
v#Me bind my soul to Egypt, and to swear
v#Allegiance to her gods. The priests of On
v#Drew near to lay their hands upon my head
v#And bid me swear, ‘Now, by Osiris, judge
v#Of all the dead, and Isis, mother of us
v#All,' that henceforth I'd forswear my kindred,
v#Tribe and race; would have no other gods
v#Than those of Egypt; would be engrafted
v#Into Pharaoh's royal line, and be called
v#The son of Pharaoh's daughter. Then, mother
v#Dear, I lived the past again. Again I sat
v#Beside thee, my lips apart with childish
v#Wonder, my eager eyes uplifted to thy
v#Glowing face, and my young soul gathering
v#Inspiration from thy words. Again I heard
v#Thee tell the grand traditions of our race,
v#The blessed hopes and glorious promises
v#That weave their golden threads among the sombre
v#Tissues of our lives, and shimmer still amid
v#The gloom and shadows of our lot. Again
v#I heard thee tell of Abraham, with his constant
v#Faith and earnest trust in God, unto whom
v#The promise came that in his seed should all
v#The nations of the earth be blessed. Of Isaac,
v#Blessing with disappointed lips his first born son,
v#From whom the birthright had departed. Of Jacob,
v#With his warm affections and his devious ways,
v#Flying berore the wrath of Esau; how he
v#Slumbered in the wild, and saw amid his dreams
v#A ladder reaching to the sky, on which God's
v#Angels did descend, and waking, with a solemn
v#Awe o'ershadowing all, his soul exclaimed, 'How
v#Dreadful is this place. Lo! God is here, and I
v#Knew it not.' Of Joseph, once a mighty prince
v#Within this land, who shrank in holy horror
v#From the soft white hand that beckoned him to sin;
v#Whose heart, amid the pleasures, pomp and pride
v#Of Egypt, was ever faithful to his race,
v#And when his life was trembling on its frailest chord
v#He turned his dying eyes to Canaan, and made
v#His brethren swear that they would make his grave
v#Among the patriarchs of his line, because
v#Machpelah's cave, where Abraham bowed before
v#The sons of Heth, and bought a place to lay
v#His loved and cherished dead, was dearer to his
v#Dying heart than the proudest tomb amid
v#The princely dead of Egypt.
v#Then, like the angels, mother dear, who met
v#Our father Jacob on his way, thy words
v#Came back as messengers of light to guide
v#My steps, and I refused to be called the son
v#Of Pharaoh's daughter. I saw the priests of On
v#Grow pale with fear, an ashen terror creeping
v#O'er the princess' face, while Pharaoh's brow grew
v#Darker than the purple of his cloak. But I
v#Endured, as seeing him who hides his face
v#Behind the brightness of his glory.
v#And thus I left the pomp and pride of Egypt
v#To cast my lot among the people of my race.”

v#The love of Moses for his race soon found
v#A stern expression. Pharaoh was building
v#A pyramid; ambitious, cold and proud,
v#He scrupled not at means to gain his ends.
v#When he feared the growing power of Israel
v#He stained his hands in children's blood, and held
v#A carnival of death in Goshen; but now
v#He wished to hand his name and memory
v#Down unto the distant ages, and instead
v#Of lading that memory with the precious
v#Fragrance of the kindest deeds and words, he
v#Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold
v#Essayed to write it out in stone, as cold
v#And hard, and heartless as himself.
v#And Israel was
v#The fated race to whom the cruel tasks
v#Were given. Day after day a cry of wrong
v#And anguish, some dark deed of woe and crime,
v#Came to the ear of Moses, and he said,
v#These reports are ever harrowing my soul;
v#I will go unto the fields where Pharaoh's
v#Officers exact their labors, and see
v#If these things be so—if they smite the feeble
v#At their tasks, and goad the aged on to toils
v#Beyond their strength–if neither age nor sex
v#Is spared the cruel smiting of their rods."
v#And Moses went to see his brethren.
v#'Twas eventide,
v#And the laborers were wending their way
v#Unto their lowly huts. 'Twas a sad sight,—
v#The young girls walked without the bounding steps
v#Of youth, with faces prematurely old,
v#As if the rosy hopes and sunny promises
v#Of life had never flushed their cheeks with girlish
v#Joy; and there were men whose faces seemed to say,
v#We bear our lot in hopeless pain, we've bent unto
v#Our burdens until our shoulders fit them,
v#And as slaves we crouch beneath our servitude
v#And toil. But there were men whose souls were cast
v#In firmer moulds, men with dark secretive eyes,
v#Which seemed to say, to day we bide our time,
v#And hide our wrath in every nerve, and only
v#Wait a fitting hour to strike the hands that press
v#Us down. Then came the officers of Pharaoh;
v#They trod as lords, their faces flushed with pride
v#And insolence, watching the laborers
v#Sadly wending their way from toil to rest.
v#And Moses' heart swelled with a mighty pain; sadly
v#Musing, he sought a path that led him
v#From the busy haunts of men. But even there
v#The cruel wrong trod in his footsteps; he heard
v#A heavy groan, then harsh and bitter words,
v#And, looking back, he saw an officer
v#Of Pharaoh smiting with rough and cruel hand
v#An aged man. Then Moses' wrath o'erflowed
v#His lips, and every nerve did tremble
v#With a sense of wrong, and bounding forth he
v#Cried unto the smiter, “Stay thy hand; seest thou
v#That aged man? His head is whiter than our
v#Desert sands; his limbs refuse to do thy
v#Bidding because thy cruel tasks have drained
v#Away their strength.” The Egyptain raised his eyes
v#With sudden wonder; who was this that dared dispute
v#His power? Only a Hebrew youth. His
v#Proud lip curved in scornful anger, and he
v#Waved a menace with his hand, saying, “back
v#To thy task base slave, nor dare resist the will
v#Of Pharaoh.” Then Moses' wrath o'erleaped the bounds
v#Of prudence, and with a heavy blow he felled
v#The smiter to the earth, and Israel had
v#One tyrant less. Moses saw the mortal paleness
v#Chase the flushes from the Egyptian's face,
v#The whitening lips that breathed no more defiance,
v#And the relaxing tension of the well knit limbs ;
v#And when he knew that he was dead, he hid
v#Him in the sand and left him to his rest.
v#Another day Moses walked
v#Abroad, and saw two brethren striving
v#For mastery; and then his heart grew full
v#Of tender pity. They were brethren, sharers
v#Of a common wrong: should not their wrongs more
v#Closely bind their hearts, and union, not division,
v#Be their strength? And feeling thus, he said, “ye
v#Are brethren, wherefore do ye strive together?”
v#But they threw back his words in angry tones
v#And asked if he had come to judge them, and would
v#Mete to them the fate of the Egyptian?
v#Then Moses knew the sand had failed to keep
v#His secret, that his life no more was safe
v#In Goshen, and he fled unto the deserts
v#Of Arabia and became a shepherd
v#For the priest of Midian.

v#Men grow strong in action, but in solitude
v#Their thoughts are ripened. Like one who cuts away
v#The bridge on which he has walked in safety
v#To the other side, so Moses cut off all retreat
v#To Pharaoh's throne, and did choose the calling
v#Most hateful to an Egyptian; he became
v#A shepherd, and led his flocks and herds amid
v#The solitudes and wilds of Midian, where he
v#Nursed in silent loneliness his earnest faith
v#In God and a constant love for kindred, tribe
v#And race. Years stole o'er him, but they took
v#No atom from his strength, nor laid one heavy weight
v#Upon his shoulders. The down upon his face
v#Had ripened to a heavy beard; the fire
v#That glowed within his youthful eye had deepened
v#To a calm and steady light, and yet his heart
v#Was just as faithful to his race as when he had
v#Stood in Pharaoh's courts and bade farewell
v#Unto his daughter.
v#There was a look of patient waiting on his face,
v#A calm, grand patience, like one who had lifted
v#Up his eyes to God and seen, with meekened face,
v#The wings of some great destiny o'ershadowing
v#All his life with strange and solemn glory.
v#But the hour came when he must pass from thought
v#To action,—when the hope of many years
v#Must reach its grand fruition, and Israel's
v#Great deliverance dawn. It happened thus:
v#One day, as Moses led his flocks, he saw
v#A fertile spot skirted by desert sands,—
v#A pleasant place for flocks and herds to nip
v#The tender grass and rest within its shady nooks;
v#And as he paused and turned, he saw a bush with fire
v#Aglow; from root to stem a lambent flame
v#Sent up its jets and sprays of purest light,
v#And yet the bush, with leaves uncrisped, uncurled,
v#Was just as green and fresh as if the breath
v#Of early spring were kissing every leaf.
v#Then Moses said I'll turn aside to see
v#This sight, and as he turned he heard a voice
v#Bidding him lay his sandals by, for Lo! he
v#Stood on holy ground. Then Moses bowed his head
v#Upon his staff and spread his mantle о'er
v#His face, lest he should see the dreadful majesty
v#Of God; and there, upon that lonely spot,
v#By Horeb's mount, his shrinking hands received
v#The burden of his God, which bade him go
v#To Egypt's guilty king, and bid him let
v#The oppressed go free.
v#Commissioned thus
v#He gathered up his flocks and herds and sought
v#The tents of Jethro, and said "I pray thee
v#Let me go and see if yet my kindred live;
v#And Jethro bade him go in peace, nor sought
v#To throw himself across the purpose of his soul.
v#Yet there was a tender parting in that home;
v#There were moistened eyes, and quivering lips,
v#And lingering claspings of the parting hand, as Jethro
v#And his daughters stood within the light of that and gave
v#Clean morn, and gave to Moses and his wife
v#And sons their holy wishes and their sad farewells.
v#For he had been a son and brother in that home
v#Since first with manly courtesy he had filled
v#The empty pails of Reuel's daughters, and found
v#A shelter 'neath his tent when flying from
v#The wrath of Pharaoh.
v#They journeyed on,
v#Moses, Zipporah and sons, she looking back
v#With tender love upon the home she had left,
v#With all its precious memories crowding round
v#Her heart, and he with eager eyes tracking
v#His path across the desert, longing once more
v#To see the long-lost faces of his distant home,
v#The loving eyes so wont to sun him with their
v#Welcome, and the aged hands that laid upon
v#His youthful head their parting blessing. They
v#Journeyed on till morning's flush and noonday
v#Splendor glided into the softened, mellowed
v#Light of eve, and the purple mists were deep’ning
v#On the cliffs and hills, when Horeb, dual
v#Crowned, arose before him; and there he met
v#His brother Aaron, sent by God to be
v#His spokesman and to bear him company
v#To Pharaoh. Tender and joyous was their greeting.
v#They talked of home and friends until the lighter
v#Ripple of their thoughts in deeper channels flowed:
v#And then they talked of Israel's bondage,
v#And the great deliverance about to dawn
v#Upon the fortunes of their race; and Moses
v#Told him of the burning bush, and how the message
v#Of his God was trembling on his lips. And thus
v#They talked until the risen moon had veiled
v#The mount in soft and silvery light; and then
v#They rested until morn, and rising up, refreshed
v#From sleep, pursued their way until they reached
v#The land of Goshen, and gathered up the elders
v#Of their race, and told them of the message
v#Of their Father's God. Then eager lips caught up
v#The words of hope and passed the joyful “news
v#Around, and all the people bowed their heads
v#And lifted up their hearts in thankfulness
v#To God.”
v#That same day
v#Moses sought an audience with the king. He found
v#Him on his throne surrounded by the princes
v#Of his court, who bowed in lowly homage
v#At his feet. And Pharaoh heard with curving lip
v#And flushing cheek the message of the Hebrew's God
v#Then asked in cold and scornful tones, “Has
v#Israel a God, and if so where has he dwelt
v#For ages? As the highest priest of Egypt
v#I have prayed to Isis, and the Nile has
v#Overflowed her banks and filled the land
v#With plenty, but these poor slaves have cried unto
v#Their God, then crept in want and sorrow
v#To their graves. Surely Mizraim's God is strong
v#And Israel's is weak; then wherefore should
v#I heed his voice, or at his bidding break
v#A single yoke?” Thus reasoned that proud king,
v#And turned a deafened ear unto the words
v#Of Moses and bis brother, and yet he felt
v#Strangely awed before their presence, because
v#They stood as men who felt the grandeur
v#Of their mission, and thought not of themselves,
v#But of their message.

v#On the next day Pharaoh called a council
v#Of his mighty men, and before them laid
v#The message of the brethren: then Amorphel,
v#Keeper of the palace and nearest lord
v#Unto the king, arose, and bending low
v#Before the throne, craved leave to speak a word.
v#Amorphel was a crafty, treacherous man,
v#With oily lips well versed in flattery
v#And courtly speech, a supple reed ready
v#To bend before his royal master's lightest
v#Breath—Pharaoh's willing tool. He said
v#“Gracious king, thou has been too lenient
v#With these slaves; light as their burdens are, they
v#Fret and chafe beneath them. They are idle
v#And the blood runs riot in their veins. Now
v#If thou would'st have these people dwell in peace,
v#Increase, I pray thee, their tasks and add unto
v#Their burdens; if they faint beneath their added
v#Tasks, they will have less time to plot sedition
v#And revolt.”
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then Rhadma, oldest lord in Pharaoh's court,
v#Arose. He was an aged man, whose white
v#And heavy beard hung low upon his breast,
v#Yet there was a hard cold glitter in his eye,
v#And on his face a proud and evil look.
v#He had been a servant to the former king,
v#And wore his signet ring upon his hand.
v#He said, “I know this Moses well. Fourscore
v#Years ago Princess Charmian found him
v#By the Nile and rescued him from death, and did
v#Choose him as her son, and had him versed in all
v#The mysteries and lore of Egypt. But blood
v#Will tell, and this base slave, with servile blood
v#Within his veins, would rather be a servant
v#Than a prince, and so, with rude and reckless hand,
v#He thrust aside the honors of our dear
v#Departed king. Pharaoh was justly wroth,
v#But for his daughter's sake he let the trespass
v#Pass. But one day this Moses slew an Egyptian
v#In his wrath, and then the king did seek his life;
v#But be fled, it is said, unto the deserts
v#Of Arabia, and became a shepherd for the priest
v#Of Midian. But now, instead of leading flocks
v#And herds, he aspires to lead his captive race
v#To freedom. These men mean mischief; sedition
v#And revolt are in their plans. Decree, I pray thee,
v#That these men shall gather their own straw
v#And yet their tale of bricks shall be the same.”
v#And these words pleased Pharaoh well, and all his
v#Lords chimed in with one accord. And Pharaoh
v#Wrote the stern decree and sent it unto Goshen—
v#That the laborers should gather their own straw,
v#And yet they should not ʼminish of their tale of bricks.
v#'Twas a sad day in Goshen;
v#The king's degree hung like a gloomy pall
v#Around their homes. The people fainted 'neath
v#Their added tasks, then cried unto the king,
v#That he would ease their burdens; but he hissed
v#A taunt into their ears and said, “ye are
v#Idle, and your minds are filled with vain
v#And foolish thoughts; get you into your tasks,
v#And ye shall not ʼminish of your tale of bricks."
v#And then they turned their eyes
v#Reproachfully on Moses and his brother,
v#And laid the cruel blame upon their shoulders.
v#'Tis an old story now, but then 'twas new
v#Unto the brethren,—how God's anointed ones
v#Must walk with bleeding feet the paths that turn
v#To lines of living light; how hands that bring
v#Salvation in their palms are pierced with cruel
v#Nails, and lips that quiver first with some great truth
v#Are steeped in bitterness and tears, and brows
v#Now bright beneath the aureola of God,
v#Have bent beneath the thorny crowns of earth.
v#There was hope for Israel,
v#But they did not see the golden fringes
v#Of their coming morn; they only saw the cold,
v#Grey sky, and fainted 'neath the cheerless gloom.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Moses sought again the presence of the king:
v#And Pharaoh's brow grew dark with wrath,
v#And rising up in angry haste, he said,
v#Defiantly, "If thy God be great, show
v#Us some sign or token of his power.”
v#Then Moses threw his rod upon the floor,
v#And it trembled with a sign of life;
v#The dark wood glowed, then changed into a thing
v#Of glistening scales and golden rings, and green,
v#And brown and purple stripes; a hissing, hateful
v#Thing, that glared its fiery eye, and darting forth
v#From Moses' side, lay coiled and panting
v#At the monarch's feet. With wonder open-eyed
v#The king gazed on the changed rod, then called
v#For his magicians—wily men, well versed
v#In sinful lore—and bade them do the same.
v#And they, leagued with the powers of night, did
v#Also change their rods to serpents; then Moses'
v#Serpent darted forth, and with a startling hiss
v#and angry gulp, he swallowed the living things
v#That coiled along his path. And thus did Moses
v#Show that Israel's God had greater power
v#Than those dark sons of night.
v#But not by this alone
v#Did God his mighty power reveal: He changed
v#Their waters; every fountain, well and pool
v#Was red with blood, and lips, all parched with thirst,
v#Shrank back in horror from the crimson draughts.
v#And then the worshiped Nile grew full of life;
v#Millions of frogs swarmed from the stream—they clogged
v#The pathway of the priests and filled the sacred
v#Fanes, and crowded into Pharaoh's bed, and hopped
v#Into his trays of bread, and slumbered in his
v#Ovens and his pans.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then came another plague, of loathsome vermin;
v#They were gray and creeping things, that made
v#Their very clothes alive with dark and sombre
v#Spots—things so loathsome in the land they did
v#Suspend the service of the temple; for no priest
v#Dared to lift his hand to any god with one
v#Of these upon him. And then the sky grew
v#Dark, as if a cloud were passing o'er its
v#Changeless blue; a buzzing sound broke o'er
v#The city, and the land was swarmed with flies.
v#The murrain laid their cattle low; the hail
v#Cut off the first fruits of the Nile; the locusts,
v#With their hungry jaws, destroyed the later crops,
v#And left the ground as brown and bare as if a fire
v#Had scorched it through,
v#Then angry blains
v#And fiery boils did blur the flesh of man
v#And beast; and then for three long days, nor saffron
v#Tint, nor crimson flush, nor soft and silvery light
v#Divided day from morn, nor told the passage
v#Of the hours; men rose not from their seats, but sat
v#In silent awe. That lengthened night lay like a burden
v#On the air,—a darkness one might almost gather
v#In his hand, it was so gross and thick. Then came
v#The last dread plague—the death of the first born.
v#'Twas midnight,
v#And a startling shriek rose from each palace,
v#Home and hut of Egypt, save the blood-besprinkled homes
v#Of Goshen; the midnight seemed to shiver with a sense
v#Of dread, as if the mystic angels wing
v#Had chilled the very air with horror.
v#Death! Death! was everywhere—in every home
v#A corpse–in every heart a bitter woe.
v#There were anxious fingerings for the pulse
v#That ne'er would throb again, and eager listenings
v#For some sound of life—a hurrying to and fro—
v#Then burning kisses on the cold lips
v#Of the dead, bitter partings, sad farewells,
v#And mournful sobs and piercing shrieks,
v#And deep and heavy groans throughout the length
v#And breadth of Egypt. 'Twas the last dread plague,
v#But it had snapped in twain the chains on which
v#The rust of ages lay, and Israel was freed;
v#Not only freed, but thrust in eager haste
v#From out the land. Trembling men stood by, and longed
v#To see them gather up their flocks and herds,
v#And household goods, and leave the land; because they felt
v#That death stood at their doors as long as Israel
v#Lingered there; and they went forth in haste,
v#To tread the paths of freedom.

v#But Pharaoh was strangely blind, and turning
v#From his first-born and his dead, with Egypt's wail
v#Scarce still upon his ear, he asked which way had
v#Israel gone? They told him that they journeyed
v#Towards the mighty sea, and were encamped
v#Near Baalzephn.
v#Then Pharaoh said, “the wilderness will hem them in,
v#The mighty sea will roll its barriers in front,
v#And with my chariots and my warlike men
v#I'll bring them back, or mete them out their graves."
v#Then Pharaoh's officers arose
v#And gathered up the armies of the king,
v#And made his chariots ready for pursuit.
v#With proud escutcheons blazoned to the sun,
v#In his chariot of ivory, pearl and gold,
v#Pharaoh rolled out of Egypt; and with him
v#Rode his mighty men, their banners floating
v#On the breeze, their spears and armor glittering
v#In the morning light; and Israel saw,
v#With fainting hearts, their old oppressors on their
v#Track: then women wept in hopeless terror;
v#Children hid their faces in their mothers' robes,
v#And strong, men bowed 'their 'heads in agony and dread;
v#And then a bitter, angry murmur rose,—
v#"Were there no graves in Egypt, that thou hast
v#Brought us here to die?”
v#'Then Moses lifted up his face, aglow
v#With earnest faith in God, and bade their fainting hearts
v#Be strong and they should his salvation see.
v#"Stand still," said Moses to the fearful throng
v#Whose hearts were fainting in the wild,“ Stand still."
v#Ah, that was Moses' word, but higher and greater
v#Came God's watchword for the hour, and not for that
v#Alone, but all the coming hours of time.
v#"Speak ye unto the people and bid them
v#Forward go; stretch thy hand across the waters
v#And smite them with thy rod.” And Moses smote
v#The restless sea; the waves stood up in heaps,
v#Then lay as calm and still as lips that just
v#Had tasted death. The secret-loving sea
v#Laid bare her coral caves and iris-tinted
v#Floor; that wall of flood which lined the people's
v#Way was God's own wondrous masonry;
v#The signal pillar sent to guide them through the wild
v#Moved its dark shadow till it fronted Egypt's
v#Camp, but hung in fiery splendor, a light
v#To Israel's path. Madly rushed the hosts
v#Of Pharaoh upon the people's track, when
v#The solemn truth broke on them—that God
v#For Israel fought. With cheeks in terror
v#Blenching, and eyes astart with fear, “let
v#Us flee,” they cried, “from Israel, for their God
v#Doth fight against us; he is battling on their side."
v#They had trusted in their chariots, but now
v#That hope was vain; God had loosened every
v#Axle and unfastened every wheel, and each
v#Face did gather blackness and each heart stood still
v#With fear, as the livid lightnings glittered
v#And the thunder roared and muttered on the air,
v#And they saw the dreadful ruin that shuddered
v#O'er their heads, for the waves began to tremble
v#And the wall of flood to bend. Then arose
v#A cry of terror, baffled hate and hopeless dread,
v#A gurgling sound of horror, as "the waves
v#Came madly dashing, wildly crashing, seeking
v#Out their place again,"and the flower and pride
v#Of Egypt sank as lead within the sea
v#Till the waves threw back their corpses cold and stark
v#Upon the shore, and the song of Israel's
v#Triumph was the requiem of their foes.
v#Oh the grandeur of that triumph; up the cliffs
v#And down the valleys, o'er the dark and restless
v#Sea, rose the people's shout of triumph, going
v#Up in praise to God, and the very air
v#Seemed joyous, for the choral song of millions
v#Throbbed upon its viewless wings.
v#Then another song of triumph rose in accents
v#Soft and clear; “'twas the voice of Moses' sister
v#Rising in the tide of song. The warm blood
v#Of her childhood seemed dancing in her veins;
v#The roses of her girlhood were flushing
v#On her cheek, and her eyes flashed out the splendor
v#Of long departed days, for time itself seemed
v#Pausing, and she lived the past again; again
v#The Nile flowed by her; she was watching by the stream,
v#A little ark of rushes where her baby brother lay;
v#The tender tide of rapture swept o'er her soul again
v#She had felt when Pharaoh's daughter had claimed
v#Him as her own, and her mother wept for joy
v#Above her rescued son. Then again she saw
v#Him choosing "’twixt Israel's pain and sorrow
v#And Egypt's pomp and pride." But now he stood
v#Their leader triumphant on that shore, and loud
v#She struck the cymbals as she led the Hebrew women
v#In music, dance and song, as they shouted out
v#Triumphs in sweet and glad refrains.

v#They journeyed on from Zuphim's sea until
v#They reached the sacred mount and heard the solemn
v#Decalogue. The mount was robed in blackness,—
v#Heavy and deep the shadows lay; the thunder
v#Crashed and roared upon the air; the lightning
v#Leaped from crag to crag; God's fearful splendor
v#Flowed around, and Sinai quaked and shuddered
v#To its base, and there did God proclaim
v#Unto their listening ears, the great, the grand,
v#The central and the primal truth of all
v#The universe—the unity of God.
v#Only one God,—
v#This truth received into the world's great life,
v#Not as an idle dream nor speculative thing,
v#But as a living, vitalizing thought,
v#Should bind us closer to our God and link us
v#With our fellow man, the brothers and co-heirs
v#With Christ, the elder brother of our race.
v#Before this truth let every blade of war
v#Grow dull, and slavery, cowering at the light,
v#Skulk from the homes of men; instead
v#Of war bring peace and freedom, love and joy,
v#And light for man, instead of bondage, whips
v#And chains. Only one God! the strongest hands
v#Should help the weak who bend before the blasts
v#Of life, because if God is only one
v#Then we are the children of his mighty hand,
v#And when we best serve man, we also serve
v#Our God. Let haughty rulers learn that men
v#Of humblest birth and lowliest lot have
v#Rights as sacred and divine as theirs, and they
v#Who fence in leagues of earth by bonds and claims
v#And title deeds, forgetting land and water,
v#Air and light are God's own gifts and heritage
v#For man—who throw their selfish lives between
v#God's sunshine and the shivering poor—
v#Have never learned the wondrous depth, nor scaled
v#The glorious height of this great central truth,
v#Around which clusters all the holiest faiths
v#Of earth. The thunder died upon the air,
v#The lightning ceased its livid play, the smoke
v#And darkness died away in clouds, as soft
v#And fair as summer wreaths that lie around
v#The setting sun, and Sinai stood a bare
v#And rugged thing among the sacred scenes
v#Of earth.

v#It was a weary thing to bear the burden
v#Of that restless and rebellious race. With
v#Sinai's thunders almost crashing in their ears,
v#They made a golden calf, and in the desert
v#Spread an idol's feast, and sung the merry songs
v#They had heard when Mizraim's songs bowed down before
v#Their vain and heathen gods; and thus for many years
v#Did Moses bear the evil manners of his race—
v#Their angry murmurs, fierce regrets and strange
v#Forgetfulness of God. Born slaves, they did not love
v#The freedom of the wild more than their pots of flesh.
v#And pleasant savory things once gathered
v#From the gardens of the Nile.
v#If slavery only laid its weight of chains
v#Upon the weary, aching limbs, e'en then
v#It were a curse; but when it frets through nerve
v#And flesh and eats into the weary soul,
v#Oh then it is a thing for every human
v#Heart to loathe, and this was Israel's fate,
v#For when the chains were shaken from their limbs,
v#They failed to strike the impress from their souls.
v#While he who'd basked beneath the radiance
v#Of a throne, ne'er turned regretful eyes upon
v#The past, nor sighed to grasp again the pleasures
v#Once resigned; but the saddest trial was
v#To see the light and joy fade from their faces
v#When the faithless spies spread through their camp
v#Their ill report; and when the people wept
v#In hopeless unbelief and turned their faces
v#Egyptward, and asked a captain from their bands
v#To lead them back where they might bind anew
v#Their broken chains, when God arose and shut
v#The gates of promise on their lives, and left
v#Their bones to bleach beneath Arabia's desert sands.
v#But though they slumbered in the wild, they died
v#With broader freedom on their lips, and for their
v#Little ones did God reserve the heritage
v#So rudely thrust aside.

v#His work was done; his blessing lay
v#Like precious ointment on his people's head,
v#And God's great peace was resting on his soul.
v#His life had been a lengthened sacrifice,
v#A thing of deep devotion to his race,
v#Since first he turned his eyes on Egypt's gild
v#And glow, and clasped their fortunes in his hand
v#And held them with a firm and constant grasp.
v#But now his work was done; his charge was laid
v#In Joshua's hand, and men of younger blood
v#Were destined to possess the land and pass
v#Through Jordan to the other side. He too
v#Had hoped to enter there—to tread the soil
v#Made sacred by the memories of his
v#Kindred dead, and rest till life's calm close beneath
v#The sheltering vines and stately palms of that
v#Fair land; that hope had colored all his life's
v#Young dreams and sent its mellowed flushes o'er
v#His later years; but God's decree was otherwise.
v#And so he bowed his meekened soul in calm
v#Submission to the word, which bade him climb
v#To Nebo's highest peak, and view the pleasant land
v#From Jordan's swells unto the calmer ripples
v#Of the tideless sea, then die with all its
v#Loveliness in sight.
v#As he passed from Moab's grassy vale to climb
v#The rugged mount, the people stood in mournful groups,
v#Some, with quivering lips and tearful eyes,
v#Reaching out unconscious hands, as if to stay
v#His steps and keep him ever at their side, while
v#Others gazed with reverent awe upon
v#The calm and solemn beauty on his aged brow,
v#The look of loving trust and lofty faith
v#Still beaming from an eye that neither care
v#Nor time had dimmed. As he passed upward, tender
v#Blessings, earnest prayers and sad farewells rose
v#On each wave of air, then died in one sweet
v#Murmur of regretful love; and Moses stood
v#Alone on Nebo's mount.
v#Alone! not one
v#Of all that mighty throng who had trod with him
v#In triumph through the parted food was there.
v#Aaron had died in Hor, with son and brother
v#By his side; and Miriam too was gone.
v#But kindred hands had made her grave, and Kadesh
v#Held her dust. But he was all alone; nor wife
v#Nor child was there to clasp in death his hand,
v#And bind around their bleeding hearts the precious
v#Parting words. And yet he was not all alone,
v#For God's great presence flowed around his path
v#And stayed him in that solemn hour.
	</p>
	<p>
v#He stood upon the highest peak of Nebo,
v#And saw the Jordan chafing through its gorges,
v#Its banks made bright by scarlet blooms
v#And purple blossoms. The placid lakes
v#And emerald meadows, the snowy crest
v#Of distant mountains, the ancient rocks
v#That dripped with honey, the hills all bathed
v#In light and beauty; the shady groves
v#And peaceful vistas, the vines opprest
v#With purple riches, the fig trees fruit-crowned
v#Green and golden, the pomegranates with crimson
v#Blushes, the olives with their darker clusters,
v#Rose before him like a vision, full of beauty
v#And delight. Gazed he on the lovely landscape
v#Till it faded from his view, and the wing
v#Of death's sweet angel hovered o'er the mountain's
v#Crest, and he heard his garments rustle through
v#The watches of the night.
v#Then another, fairer, vision
v#Broke upon his longing gaze; 'twas the land
v#Of crystal fountains, love and beauty, joy
v#And light, for the pearly gates flew open,
v#And his ransomed soul went in. And when morning
v#O'er the mountain fringed each crag and peak with light,
v#Cold and lifeless lay the leader. God had touched
v#His eyes with slumber, giving his beloved sleep.
</p>
<p>
v#Oh never on that mountain
v#Was seen a lovelier sight
v#Than the troupe of fair young angels
v#That gathered 'round the dead.
v#With gentle hands they bore bim,
v#That bright and shining train,
v#From Nebo's lonely mountain
v#To sleep in Moab's vale.
v#But they sung no mornful dirges,
v#No solemn requiems said,
v#And the soft wave of their pinions
v#Made music as they trod.
v#But no one heard them passing,
v#None saw their chosen grave;
v#It was the angels secret
v#Where Moses should be laid.
v#And when the grave was finished,
v#They trod with golden sandals
v#Above the sacred spot,
v#And the brightest, fairest flowers
v#Sprang up beneath their tread.
v#Nor broken turf, nor hillock
v#Did e'er reveal that grave,
v#And truthful lips have never said
v#We know where he is laid.

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Ragged Stocking</h2>
			<p>
v#Do you see this ragged stocking,
v##Here a rent and there a hole?
v#Each thread of this little stocking
v##Is woven around my soul.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Do you wish to hear my story?
v##Excuse me, the tears will start.
v#For the sight of this ragged stocking
v##Stirs the fountains of my heart.
	</p>
	<p>
v#You say that my home is happy ;
v##To me 'tis earth's fairest place,
v#But its sunshine, peace and gladness
v##Back to this stocking I trace.
	</p>
	<p>
v#I was once a wretched drunkard ;
v##Ah! you start and say not so ;
v#But the dreadful depths I've sounded,
v##And I speak of what I know.
	</p>
	<p>
v#I was wild and very reckless
v##When I stood on manhood's brink,
v#And, joining with pleasure-seekers
v##Learned to revel and drink.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Strong drink is a raging demon,
v##In his hands are shame and woe ;
v#He mocketh the strength of the mighty
v##And bringeth the strong man low.
	</p>
	<p>
v#The light of my home was darkened
v##By the shadow of my sin;
v#And want and woe unbarr'd the door,
v##And suffering entered in.
	</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>
v#The streets were full one Christmas eve,
v##And alive with girls and boys,
v#Merrily looking through window-panes
v##At bright and beautiful toys.
	</p>
	<p>
v#And throngs of parents came to buy
v##The gifts that children prize,
v#And homeward trudged with happy hearts,
v##The love-light in their eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
v#I thought of my little Charley
v##At home in his lowly bed,
v#With the shadows around his life,
v##And in shame I bowed my head.
	</p>
	<p>
v#I entered my home a sober man,
v##My heart by remorse was wrung,
v#And there in the chimney corner,
v##This little stocking was hung.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Faded and worn as you see it ;
v##To me 'tis a precious thing.
v#And I never gaze upon it
v##But unbidden tears will spring.
	</p>
	<p>
v#I began to search my pockets,
v##But scarcely a dime was there;
v#But scanty as was the pittance,
v##This stocking received its share.
	</p>
	<p>
v#For a longing seized upon me
v##To gladden the heart of my boy.
v#And I bought him some cakes and candy,
v##And added a simple toy.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then I knelt by this little stocking
v##And sobbed out an earnest prayer,
v#And arose with strength to wrestle
v##And break from the tempter's snare.
	</p>
	<p>
v#And this faded, worn-out stocking,
v##So pitiful once to see,
v#Became the wedge that broke my chain,
v##And a blessing brought to me.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Do you marvel then I prize it?
v##When each darn and seam and liole
v#Is linked with my soul's deliverance
v##From the bondage of the bowl ?
	</p>
	<p>
v#And to night my wife will tell you.
v##Though I've houses, gold and land,
v#He holds no treasure more precious
v##Than this stocking in my hand.

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Fatal Pledge</h2>
			<p>
v#"Pledge me with wine," the maiden cried,
v##Her tones were gay and light ;
v#"From others you have turned aside,
v##I claim your pledge to-night."
	</p>
	<p>
v#The blood rushed to the young man's cheek
v##Then left it deadly pale;
v#Beneath the witchery of her smile
v##He felt his courage fail.
	</p>
	<p>
v#For many years he'd been a slave
v##To the enchanting bowl,
v#Until he grasped with eager hands
v##The reins of self-control ;
	</p>
	<p>
v#And struggled with his hated thrall,
v##Until he rent his chain,
v#And strove to stand erect and free,
v##And be a man again.
	</p>
	<p>
v#When others came with tempting words
v##He coldly turned aside.
v#But she who held the sparkling cup
v##Was his affianced bride ;
	</p>
	<p>
v#And like a vision of delight.
v##Bright, beautiful and fair,
v#With thoughtless words she wove for him
v##The meshes of despair.
	</p>
	<p>
v#From jeweled hands he took the cup,
v##Nor heard the serpent's hiss ;
v#Nor saw beneath its ruby glow
v##The deadly adder's hiss.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Like waves that madly, wildly dash,
v##When dykes are overthrown.
v#The barriers of his soul gave way,
v##Each life with wrecks was strewn.
	</p>
	<p>
v#And she who might have reached her hand
v##To succor and to save,
v#Soon wept in hopeless agony
v##Above a drunkard's grave.
	</p>
	<p>
v#And bore through life with bleeding heart
v##Remembrance of that night,
v#When she had urged the tempted man
v##With wine to make his plight.

v#He had plunged into our sorrows,
v##And our sin had pierced his heart,
v#As before him loomed death's shadow,
v##And he knew he must depart.
	</p>
	<p>
v#But they hailed him as a victor
v##As he into Salem came,
v#And the very children shouted
v##Loud hosannas to his name.
	</p>

v#Bat he knew behind that triumph,
v##Rising gladly to the sky,
v#Soon would come the cries of malice:
v##Crucify him! Crucify!

v#Onward rode the blessed Saviour,
v##Conscious of the coming strife
v#Soon to break in storms of hatred
v##Round his dear, devoted life.

v#Ghastly in its fearful anguish
v##Rose the cross before his eyes,
v#But he saw the joy beyond it,
v##And did all the shame despise.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Joy to see the cry of scorning
v##Through the ages ever bright,
v#And the cross of shame transfigured
v##To a throne of love and lioht.

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Resurrection of Jesus</h2>
			<p>
v#It was done, the deed of horror ;
v##Christ had died upon the cross.
v#And within an upper chamber
v##The disciples mourned their loss.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Peter's eyes were full of anguish,
v##Thinking sadly of the trial
v#When his boasted self-reliance
v##Ended in his Lord's deniaL
	</p>
	<p>
v#Disappointment, deep and heavy.
v##Shrouded every heart with gloom,
v#As the hopes so fondly cherished
v##Died around the garden tomb.
	</p>
	<p>
v#And they thought with shame and sorrow
v##How they fled in that dark hour,
v#When they saw tlieir Lord and Master
v##In the clutch of Roman power.
	</p>
	<p>
v#We had hoped, they sadly uttered,
v##He would over Israel reign,
v#But to-day he lies sepulchred.
v##And our cherished hopes are vain.
	</p>
	<p>
v#In the humble home of Mary
v##Slowly waned the hours away,
v#Till she rose to seek the garden
v##And the place where Jesus lay.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Not the cross with all its anguish
v##Could her loving heart restrain,
v#But the tomb she sought was empty,
v##And her heart o'erflowed with pain.
	</p>
	<p>
v#To embalm my Lord and Master
v##To this garden I have strayed.
v#But, behold, I miss his body.
v##And I know not where he's laid.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then a wave of strange emotion
v##Swept her soul, as angels said,
v#"Wherefore do ye seek the living
v##'Mid the chambers of the dead? "
	</p>
	<p>
v#Unperceived, her Lord stood by her,
v##Silent witness of her grief,
v#Bearing on his lips the tidings
v##Sure to bring a glad relief
	</p>
	<p>
v#But her tear-dimmed eyes were holden
v##When she heard the Master speak ;
v#Til ought she, only 'tis the gardener
v##Asking whom her soul did seek.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then a sudden flush of gladness
v##O'er her grief- worn features spread;
v#When she knew the voice of Jesus
v##All her bitter anguish fled.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Forth she reached hands in rapture.
v##Touch me not, the Saviour said ;
v#Take the message to my brethren,
v##I have risen from the dead.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Take them words of joy and comfort,
v##Which will all their mourning end;
v#To their Father and my Father,
v##Tell them that I will ascend.
	</p>
	<p>
v#"Brethren, I have seen the Master:
v##He is risen from the dead."
v#But like words of idle meaning
v##Seemed the glorious words she said.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Soon they saw the revelation
v##Which would bid their mourning cease;
v#Christ, the risen, stood before them
v##Breathing words of love and peace.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Timid men were changed to heroes,
v##Weakness turned to wondrous might.
v#And the cross became their standard,
v##Luminous with love and light.
	</p>
	<p>
v#From that lonely upper chamber,
v##Holding up the rugged cross,
v#With a glad and bold surrender
v##They encountered shame and loss.
	</p>
	<p>
v#In these days of doubt and error,
v##In the conflict for the right,
v#May our hearts be ever strengthened
v##By the resurrection's might.

v#They took away his seamless robe,

v#The friends he loved unto the end,

v#Beneath the shadow of that cross

	<p>
v#And yet within our favored land.

v#He is coming, she said, to Simon's feast.
v##The prophet of Galilee,
v#Though multitudes around him throng
v##In longing his face to see.
	</p>
	<p>
v#He enters the home as Simon's guest,
v##But he gives no welcome kiss ;
v#He brings no water to bathe his feet —
v##Why is Simon so remiss ?
	</p>
	<p>
v#The prophet's face is bright with love,
v##And mercy beams from his eye ;
v#He pities the poor, the lame and blind,
v##An outcast, I will draw nigh.
	</p>
	<p>
v#If a prophet, he will surely know
v##The guilt of my darkened years ;
v#With broken heart I'll seek his face,
v##And bathe his feet with my tears.
	</p>
	<p>
v#No holy rabbi lays his hand
v##In blessing on my head ;
v#No loving voice floats o'er the path,
v##The downward path I tread.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Unto the Master's side she pressed,
v##A penitent, frail and fair,
v#Rained on his feet a flood of tears.
v##And then wiped them with her hair.

	<p>
v#Over the face of Simon swept
v##An air of puzzled surprise ;
v#Can my guest a holy prophet be,
v##And not this woman despise?

v#Christ saw the thoughts that Simon's heart
v##Had written upon his face,
v#Kindly turned to the sinful one
v##In her sorrow and disgrace.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Where Simon only saw the stains,
v##Where sin and shame were rife,
v#Christ looked beneath and saw the germs
v##Of a fair, outflowering life.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Like one who breaks a galling chain,
v##And sets a prisoner free,
v#He rent her fetters with the words,
v##''Thy sins are forgiven thee."
	</p>
	<p>
v#God be praised for the gracious words
v##Which came through that woman's touch
v#That souls redeemed thro' God's dear Son
v##May learn to love him so much ;
	</p>
	<p>
v#That souls once red with guilt and crime
v##May their crimson stains outgrow ;
v#The scarlet spots upon their lives
v##Become whiter than driven snow.
