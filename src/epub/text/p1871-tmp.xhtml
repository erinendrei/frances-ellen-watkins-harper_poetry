	Have the bright and glowing visions<br/>
	Faded from thy longing sight,<br/>
	Like the gorgeous tints of ev'n<br/>
	Mingling with the shades of night?<br/>
	<br/>
	Didst thou hope to see thy country<br/>
	Wearing Justice as a crown,<br/>
	Standing foremost ’mid the nations<br/>
	Worthy of the world's renown?<br/>
	<br/>
	Didst thou think the grand fruition<br/>
	Reached the fullness of its time,<br/>
	When the crater of God's judgment<br/>
	Overflowed the nation's crime?<br/>
	<br/>
	That thy people, purged by fire,<br/>
	Would have irur! -nother path,<br/>
	Careful, lest their feet should stumble<br/>
	On the cinders of God's wrath?<br/>
	<br/>
	And again the injured negro<br/>
	Grind the dreadful mills of fate,<br/>
	Pressing out the fearful vintage<br/>
	Of the nation's scorn and hate?<br/>
	<br/>
	Sadder than the crimson shadows<br/>
	Hung for years around our skies,<br/>
	Are the hopes so fondly cherished<br/>
	Fading now before thine eyes.<br/>
	<br/>
	Not in vain has been thy hoping,<br/>
	Though thy fair ideals fade,<br/>
	If, like one of God's tall aloes,<br/>
	Thou art rip’ning in the shade.<br/>
	<br/>
	There is light beyond the darkness,<br/>
	Joy beyond the present pain;<br/>
	There is hope in God's great justice,<br/>
	And the negro's rising brain.<br/>
	<br/>
	Though before the timid counsels<br/>
	Truth and Right may seem to fail,<br/>
	God hath bathed his sword in judgment,<br/>
	And his arm shall yet prevail.<br/>

	When a dark and fearful strife<br/>
	Raged around the nation's life,<br/>
	And the traitor plunged his steel<br/>
	Where your quivering hearts could feel,<br/>
	When your cause did need a friend,<br/>
	We were faithful to the end.<br/>
	<br/>
	When we stood with bated breath,<br/>
	Facing fiery storms of death,<br/>
	And the war-cloud, red with wrath,<br/>
	Fiercely swept around our path,<br/>
	Did our hearts with terror quail?<br/>
	Or our courage ever fail?<br/>
	<br/>
	When the captive, wanting bread,<br/>
	Sought our poor and lowly shed,<br/>
	And the blood-hounds missed his way,<br/>
	Did we e'er his path betray?<br/>

	<br/>
	With your soldiers, side by side,<br/>
	Helped we turn the battle's tide,<br/>
	Till o'er ocean, stream and shore,<br/>
	Waved the rebel flag no more,<br/>
	And above the rescued sod<br/>
	Praises rose to freedom's God,<br/>
	<br/>
	But to-day the traitor stands<br/>
	With the crimson on his hands,<br/>
	Scowling 'neath his brow of hate,<br/>
	On our weak and desolate,<br/>
	With the blood-rust on the knife<br/>
	Aiméd at the nation's life.<br/>
	<br/>
	Asking you to weakly yield<br/>
	All we won upon the field,<br/>
	To ignore, on land and flood,<br/>
	All the offerings of our blood,<br/>
	And to write above our slain<br/>
	"They have fought and died in vain."<br/>
	<br/>
	To your manhood we appeal,<br/>
	Lest the traitor's iron heel<br/>
	Grind and trample in the dust<br/>
	All our new-born hope and trust,<br/>
	And the name of freedom be<br/>
	Linked with bitter mockery.<br/>

	A rock, for ages, stern and high,<br/>
	Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,<br/>
	And never bowed his baughty crest<br/>
	When angry storms around him prest.<br/>
	<br/>
	Morn springing from the arms of night<br/>
	Had often bathed his brow with light,<br/>
	And kissed the shadows from his face<br/>
	With tender love and gentle grace.<br/>
	<br/>
	Day, pausing at the gates of rest,<br/>
	Smiled on him from the distant West,<br/>
	And from her throne the dark-browed Night<br/>
	Threw round his path her softest light.<br/>
	And yet he stood unmoved and proud,<br/>
	Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;<br/>
	<br/>
	He bared his brow to every blast<br/>
	And scorned the tempest as it passed.<br/>
	One day a tiny, humble seed-<br/>
	The keenest eye would hardly heed-<br/>
	Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,<br/>
	And found a lowly hiding place.<br/>
	A ray of light, and drop of dew,<br/>
	Came with a message, kind and true;<br/>
	They told her of the world so bright,<br/>
	Its love, its joy, and rosy light,<br/>
	And lured her from her hiding place,<br/>
	<br/>
	To gaze upon earth's glorious face.<br/>
	So, peeping timid from the ground,<br/>
	She clasped the ancient rock around,<br/>
	And climbing up with childish grace,<br/>
	She held him with a close embrace;<br/>
	Her clinging was a thing of dread;<br/>
	Where'er she touched a fissure spread,<br/>
	And he who'd breasted many a storm<br/>
	Stood frowning there, a mangled form;<br/>
	So Truth dropped in the silent earth,<br/>
	May seem a thing of little worth,<br/>
	Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,<br/>
	It saps its pillars proud and strong.<br/>

	'Twas a fearful night—the tempest raved<br/>
	With loud and wrathful pride,<br/>
	The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds,<br/>
	And rode on the raging tide.<br/>
	<br/>
	The sea-king lay on his bed of death.<br/>
	Pale mourners around him bent,<br/>
	They knew the wild and fitful life<br/>
	Of their chief was almost spent.<br/>
	<br/>
	His ear was growing dull in death<br/>
	When the angry storm he heard,<br/>
	The sluggish blood in the old man's veins<br/>
	With sudden vigor stirred.<br/>
	<br/>
	"I hear them call,” cried the dying man,<br/>
	His eyes grew full of light,<br/>
	"Now bring me here my warrior robes,<br/>
	My sword and armor bright.<br/>
	<br/>
	"In the tempest's lull I heard a voice,<br/>
	I knew ’t was Odin's call.<br/>
	The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed<br/>
	To lead me unto his hall.<br/>
	<br/>
	"Bear me unto my noblest ship,<br/>
	Light up a funeral pyre;<br/>
	I'll walk to the palace of the braves<br/>
	Through a path of flame and fire.”<br/>
	<br/>
	O! wild and bright was the stormy light<br/>
	That flashed from the old man's eye,<br/>
	As they bore him from the couch of death<br/>
	To his battle-ship to die.<br/>
	<br/>
	And lit with many a mournful torch<br/>
	The sea-king's dying bed,<br/>
	And like a banner fair and bright<br/>
	The flames around him spread.<br/>
	<br/>
	But they heard no cry of anguish<br/>
	Break through that fiery wall,<br/>
	With rigid brow and silent lips<br/>
	He was seeking Odin's hall<br/>
	<br/>
	Through a path of fearful splendor,<br/>
	While strong men held their breath,<br/>
	The brave old man went boldly forth<br/>
	And calmly talked with death.<br/>

	Cruel in vengeance, reckless in wrath,<br/>
	The hunters of men bore down on our path;<br/>
	Inhuman and fierce, the offer they gave<br/>
	Was ireedom in death or the life of a slave.<br/>
	The cheek of the mother grew pallid with dread,<br/>
	As the tidings of evil around us were spread,<br/>
	And closer and closer she strained to her heart<br/>
	The children she feared they would sever apart.<br/>
	The brows of our maidens grew gloomy and sad;<br/>
	Hot tears burst from eyes once sparkling and glad.<br/>
	Our young men stood ready to join in the fray,<br/>
	That hung as a pall 'round our people that day.<br/>
	Our leaders gazed angry and stern on the strife,<br/>
	For freedom to them was dearer than life.<br/>
	There was mourning at home and death in the street,<br/>
	For carnage and famine together did meet.<br/>
	The pale lips of hunger were asking for bread,<br/>
	While husbands and fathers lay bleeding and dead.<br/>
	For days we withstood the tempests of wrath,<br/>
	That scattered destruction and death in our path,<br/>
	Till, broken and peeled, we yielded at last,<br/>
	And the glory and strength of our kingdom were past.<br/>
	But Zombi, our leader, and warlike old chief,<br/>
	Gazed down on our woe with anger and grief;<br/>
	The tyrant for him forged fetters in vain,<br/>
	His freedom-girt limbs had worn their last chain.<br/>
	Defiance and daring still flashed from his eye;<br/>
	A freenan he'd lived and free he would die.<br/>
	So he climbed to the verge of a dangerous steep,<br/>
	Resolved from its margin to take a last leap;<br/>
	For a fearful death and a bloody grave<br/>
	Were dearer to him than the life of a slave.<br/>
	Nor went he alone to the mystic land-<br/>
	There were other warriors in his band,<br/>
	Who rushed with him to Death's dark gate,<br/>
	All wrapped in the shroud of a mournful fate.<br/>

	"Go, tell the King,” she proudly said,<br/>

	"Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand<br/>

	Till glimpses of light and beauty<br/>
	Gilded our gloomy fears.<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	An angel stood at our threshold,<br/>
	We thought him a child of night,<br/>
	Till we saw the print of his steps<br/>
	Made lines of living light.<br/>
	We had much the world calls precious;<br/>
	We had heaps of shining dust;<br/>
	He laid his hand on our treasures,<br/>
	And wrote on them moth and rust.<br/>
	But still we had other treasures,<br/>
	That gold was too poor to buy,<br/>
	We clasped them closer and closer,<br/>
	But saw them fade and die.<br/>
	Our spirit grew faint and heavy,<br/>
	Deep shadows lay on our years,<br/>
	Till light from the holy city,<br/>
	Streamed through our mist of tears.<br/>
	And we thanked the chastening angel<br/>
	Who shaded our earthly light,<br/>
	For the light and beautiful visions<br/>
	That broke on our clearer sight.<br/>
	Our first view of the Holy City<br/>
	Came through our darken'd years,<br/>
	The songs that lightened our sorrows,<br/>
	We heard ʼmid our night of tears.<br/>
