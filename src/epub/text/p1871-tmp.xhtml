v#Have the bright and glowing visions
v##Faded from thy longing sight,
v#Like the gorgeous tints of ev'n
v##Mingling with the shades of night?
	</p>
	<p>
v#Didst thou hope to see thy country
v##Wearing Justice as a crown,
v#Standing foremost ’mid the nations
v##Worthy of the world's renown?
	</p>
	<p>
v#Didst thou think the grand fruition
v##Reached the fullness of its time,
v#When the crater of God's judgment
v##Overflowed the nation's crime?
	</p>
	<p>
v#That thy people, purged by fire,
v##Would have irur! -nother path,
v#Careful, lest their feet should stumble
v##On the cinders of God's wrath?
	</p>
	<p>
v#And again the injured negro
v##Grind the dreadful mills of fate,
v#Pressing out the fearful vintage
v##Of the nation's scorn and hate?
	</p>
	<p>
v#Sadder than the crimson shadows
v##Hung for years around our skies,
v#Are the hopes so fondly cherished
v##Fading now before thine eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Not in vain has been thy hoping,
v##Though thy fair ideals fade,
v#If, like one of God's tall aloes,
v##Thou art rip’ning in the shade.
	</p>
	<p>
v#There is light beyond the darkness,
v##Joy beyond the present pain;
v#There is hope in God's great justice,
v##And the negro's rising brain.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Though before the timid counsels
v##Truth and Right may seem to fail,
v#God hath bathed his sword in judgment,
v##And his arm shall yet prevail.

v#When a dark and fearful strife
v#Raged around the nation's life,
v#And the traitor plunged his steel
v#Where your quivering hearts could feel,
v#When your cause did need a friend,
v#We were faithful to the end.
</p>
<p>
v#When we stood with bated breath,
v#Facing fiery storms of death,
v#And the war-cloud, red with wrath,
v#Fiercely swept around our path,
v#Did our hearts with terror quail?
v#Or our courage ever fail?
	</p>
	<p>
v#When the captive, wanting bread,
v#Sought our poor and lowly shed,
v#And the blood-hounds missed his way,
v#Did we e'er his path betray?
v#Filled we not his heart with trust
v#As we shared with him our crust?
	</p>
	<p>
v#With your soldiers, side by side,
v#Helped we turn the battle's tide,
v#Till o'er ocean, stream and shore,
v#Waved the rebel flag no more,
v#And above the rescued sod
v#Praises rose to freedom's God,
	</p>
	<p>
v#But to-day the traitor stands
v#With the crimson on his hands,
v#Scowling 'neath his brow of hate,
v#On our weak and desolate,
v#With the blood-rust on the knife
v#Aiméd at the nation's life.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Asking you to weakly yield
v#All we won upon the field,
v#To ignore, on land and flood,
v#All the offerings of our blood,
v#And to write above our slain
v#"They have fought and died in vain."
	</p>
	<p>
v#To your manhood we appeal,
v#Lest the traitor's iron heel
v#Grind and trample in the dust
v#All our new-born hope and trust,
v#And the name of freedom be
v#Linked with bitter mockery.

v#A rock, for ages, stern and high,
v#Stood frowning 'gainst the earth and sky,
v#And never bowed his baughty crest
v#When angry storms around him prest.
v#Morn springing from the arms of night
v#Had often bathed his brow with light,
v#And kissed the shadows from his face
v#With tender love and gentle grace.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Day, pausing at the gates of rest,
v#Smiled on him from the distant West,
v#And from her throne the dark-browed Night
v#Threw round his path her softest light.
v#And yet he stood unmoved and proud,
v#Nor love, nor wrath, his spirit bowed;
v#He bared his brow to every blast
v#And scorned the tempest as it passed.
	</p>
	<p>
v#One day a tiny, humble seed-
v#The keenest eye would hardly heed-
v#Fell trembling at that stern rock’s base,
v#And found a lowly hiding place.
v#A ray of light, and drop of dew,
v#Came with a message, kind and true;
v#They told her of the world so bright,
v#Its love, its joy, and rosy light,
v#And lured her from her hiding place,
v#To gaze upon earth's glorious face.
	</p>
	<p>
v#So, peeping timid from the ground,
v#She clasped the ancient rock around,
v#And climbing up with childish grace,
v#She held him with a close embrace;
v#Her clinging was a thing of dread;
v#Where'er she touched a fissure spread,
v#And he who'd breasted many a storm
v#Stood frowning there, a mangled form;
v#So Truth dropped in the silent earth,
v#May seem a thing of little worth,
v#Till, spreading round some mighty wrong,
v#It saps its pillars proud and strong.

v#'Twas a fearful night—the tempest raved
v##With loud and wrathful pride,
v#The storm-king harnessed his lightning steeds,
v##And rode on the raging tide.
	</p>
	<p>
v#The sea-king lay on his bed of death.
v##Pale mourners around him bent,
v#They knew the wild and fitful life
v##Of their chief was almost spent.
	</p>
	<p>
v#His ear was growing dull in death
v##When the angry storm he heard,
v#The sluggish blood in the old man's veins
v##With sudden vigor stirred.
	</p>
	<p>
v#"I hear them call,” cried the dying man,
v##His eyes grew full of light,
v#"Now bring me here my warrior robes,
v##My sword and armor bright.
	</p>
	<p>
v#"In the tempest's lull I heard a voice,
v##I knew ’t was Odin's call.
v#The Valkyrs are gathering round my bed
v##To lead me unto his hall.
	</p>
	<p>
v#"Bear me unto my noblest ship,
v##Light up a funeral pyre;
v#I'll walk to the palace of the braves
v##Through a path of flame and fire.”
	</p>
	<p>
v#O! wild and bright was the stormy light
v##That flashed from the old man's eye,
v#As they bore him from the couch of death
v##To his battle-ship to die.
	</p>
	<p>
v#And lit with many a mournful torch
v##The sea-king's dying bed,
v#And like a banner fair and bright
v##The flames around him spread.
	</p>
	<p>
v#But they heard no cry of anguish
v##Break through that fiery wall,
v#With rigid brow and silent lips
v##He was seeking Odin's hall
	</p>
	<p>
v#Through a path of fearful splendor,
v##While strong men held their breath,
v#The brave old man went boldly forth
v##And calmly talked with death.

			</hgroup>
			<p>
v#Cruel in vengeance, reckless in wrath,
v#The hunters of men bore down on our path;
v#Inhuman and fierce, the offer they gave
v#Was ireedom in death or the life of a slave.
v#The cheek of the mother grew pallid with dread,
v#As the tidings of evil around us were spread,
v#And closer and closer she strained to her heart
v#The children she feared they would sever apart.
v#The brows of our maidens grew gloomy and sad;
v#Hot tears burst from eyes once sparkling and glad.
v#Our young men stood ready to join in the fray,
v#That hung as a pall 'round our people that day.
v#Our leaders gazed angry and stern on the strife,
v#For freedom to them was dearer than life.
v#There was mourning at home and death in the street,
v#For carnage and famine together did meet.
v#The pale lips of hunger were asking for bread,
v#While husbands and fathers lay bleeding and dead.
v#For days we withstood the tempests of wrath,
v#That scattered destruction and death in our path,
v#Till, broken and peeled, we yielded at last,
v#And the glory and strength of our kingdom were past.
v#But Zombi, our leader, and warlike old chief,
v#Gazed down on our woe with anger and grief;
v#The tyrant for him forged fetters in vain,
v#His freedom-girt limbs had worn their last chain.
v#Defiance and daring still flashed from his eye;
v#A freenan he'd lived and free he would die.
v#So he climbed to the verge of a dangerous steep,
v#Resolved from its margin to take a last leap;
v#For a fearful death and a bloody grave
v#Were dearer to him than the life of a slave.
v#Nor went he alone to the mystic land-
v#There were other warriors in his band,
v#Who rushed with him to Death's dark gate,
v#All wrapped in the shroud of a mournful fate.

v#All waiting stood the chamberlains
v##To hear the Queen's reply,
v#They saw her cheek grow deathly pale,
v##But light flash'd to her eye:
	</p>
	<p>
v#"Go, tell the King,” she proudly said,
v##"That I am Persia's Queen,
v#And by his crowds of merry men
v##I never will be seen.

	<p>
v#"I'll take the crown from off my head
v##And tread it ’neath my feet
v#Before their rude and careless gaze
v##My shrinking eyes shall meet.

	<p>
v#"A queen unveil'd before the crowd!—
v##Upon each lip my name!—
v#Why, Persia's women all would blush
v##And weep for Vashti's shame!
	</p>
	<p>
v#"Go back!" she cried, and waived her hand,
v##And grief was in her eye:
v#"Go, tell the King,” she sadly said,
v##"That I would rather die."
	</p>
	<p>
v#"They brought her message to the King,
v##Dark flash'd his angry eye;
v#’T was as the lightning ere the storm
v##Hath swept in fury by.
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then bitterly outspoke the King,
v##Through purple lips of wrath-
v#What shall be done to her who dares
v##To cross your monarch's path ?”
	</p>
	<p>
v#Then spake his wily counsellors-
v##"O King of this fair land!
v#From distant Ind to Ethiop,
v##All bow to thy command.
	</p>
	<p>
v#"But if, before thy servants' eyes,
v##This thing they plainly see,
v#That Vashti doth not heed thy will
v##Nor yield herself to thee,
	</p>
	<p>
v#"The women, restive 'neath our rule,
v##Would learn to scorn our name,
v#And from her deed to us would come
v##Reproach and burning shame.
	</p>
	<p>
v#"Then, gracious King, sign with thy hand
v##This stern but just decree,
v#That Vashti lay aside her crown,
v##Thy Queen no more to be.”
	</p>
	<p>
v#She heard again the King's command,
v##And left her high estate,
v#Strong in her earnest womanhood,
v##She calmly met her fate,
	</p>
	<p>
v#And left the palace of the King,
v##Proud of her spotless name-
v#A woman who could bend to grief,
v##But would not bow to shame.
