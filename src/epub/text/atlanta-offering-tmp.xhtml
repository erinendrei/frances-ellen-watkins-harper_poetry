			<p>
				<span>My mother’s kiss, my mother’s kiss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I feel its impress now;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in the bright and happy days</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She pressed it on my brow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You say it is a fancied thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within my memory fraught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me it has a sacred place⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The treasure house of thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again, I feel her fingers glide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid my clustering hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see the love-light in her eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When all my life was fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again, I hear her gentle voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In warning or in love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How precious was the faith that taught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My soul of things above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The music of her voice is stilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her lips are paled in death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As precious pearls I’ll clasp her words</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until my latest breath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The world has scattered round my path</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Honor and wealth and fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But naught so precious as the thoughts</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gather round her name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And friends have placed upon my brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The laurels of renown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she first taught me how to wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My manhood as a crown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My hair is silvered o’er with age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’m longing to depart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To clasp again my mother’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be a child at heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To roam with her the glory-land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where saints and angels greet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cast our crowns with songs of love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At our Redeemer’s feet.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Grain of Sand</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Do you see this grain of sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying loosely in my hand?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do you know to me it brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just a simple loving thought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When one gazes night by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the glorious stars of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oh how little seems the span</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Measured round the life of man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! how fleeting are his years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their smiles and their tears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can it be that God does care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such atoms as we are?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then outspake this grain of sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I was fashioned by His hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the star lit realms of space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I was made to have a place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should the ocean flood the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were its mountains ’gainst me hurled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the force they could employ</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wouldn’t a single grain destroy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I, a thing so light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have a place within His sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You are linked unto his throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot live nor die alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In the everlasting arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid life’s dangers and alarms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let calm trust your spirit fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know He’s God, and then be still.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trustingly I raised my head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hearing what the atom said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing man is greater far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the brightest sun or star.</span>

				<span>And they knew that Earth was longing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see them all again.</span>

			<p>
				<span>While the snow-drops still were sleeping</span>

				<br/>
				<span>They felt their new life pulsing</span>

				<span>Not a daffodil nor daisy</span>
				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though a tremor of the winter</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did shivering through them run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet they lifted up their foreheads</span>

				<span class="i1">To greet the vernal sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the sunbeams gave them welcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As did the morning air⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scattered o’er their simple robes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rich tints of beauty rare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon a host of lovely flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From vales and woodland burst;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in all that fair procession</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crocuses were first.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>First to weave for Earth a chaplet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To crown her dear old head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to beautify the pathway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where winter still did tread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And their loved and white haired mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smiled sweetly ’neath the touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she knew her faithful children</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were loving her so much.</span>

				<span>Outcast from her home in Syria</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the lonely, dreary wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy hearted, sorrow stricken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sat a mother and her child.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There was not a voice to cheer her</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not a soul to share her fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was weary, he was fainting⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And life seemed so desolate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far away in sunny Egypt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was lone Hagar’s native land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Nile in kingly bounty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatters bread throughout the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the tents of princely Abram</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She for years had found a home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the stern decree of Sarah</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent her forth the wild to roam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hour by hour she journeyed onward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the shelter of their tent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till her footsteps slowly faltered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the water all was spent;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she veiled her face in sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feared her child would die of thirst;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till her eyes with tears so holden</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw a sparkling fountain burst.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! how happy was that mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What a soothing of her pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she saw her child reviving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Life rejoicing through each vein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Does not life repeat this story,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Of the fountains of refreshment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever springing by our way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here is one by which we gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this bright and happy day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just to bask beside a fountain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Making gladder life’s highway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bringing unto hearts now aged</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who have borne life’s burdens long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such a gift of love and mercy</span>

				<span class="i1">As deserves our sweetest song.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such a gift that even heaven</span>

				<span class="i1">Then harshly press me down?</span>

			<p>
				<span>Crime has no sex and yet to-day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I wear the brand of shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whilst he amid the gay and proud</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still bears an honored name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Can you blame me if I’ve learned to think</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Would you blame me if to-morrow</span>

				<span>I’m glad God’s ways are not our ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He does not see as man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within His love I know there’s room</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For those whom others ban.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think before His great white throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His throne of spotless light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whited sepulchres shall wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hue of endless night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That I who fell, and he who sinned,</span>

				<span class="i1">Shall reap as we have sown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That each the burden of his loss</span>

				<span>On the bondman’s latest breath,</span>

				<span>Of the cold, hard hand of Death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had been an Afric chieftain,</span>

				<span>Worn his manhood as a crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But upon the field of battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been fiercely stricken down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had longed to gain his freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited, watched and hoped in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till his life was slowly ebbing⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost broken was his chain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By his bedside stood the master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazing on the dying one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing by the dull grey shadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That life’s sands were almost run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Master,” said the dying bondman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Home and friends I soon shall see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But before I reach my country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master write that I am free;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For the spirits of my fathers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would shrink back from me in pride,</span>

				<span>If I told them at our greeting</span>

				<span>Master! write it, write it quickly!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master! write that I am free!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At his earnest plea the master</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrote for him the glad release,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er his wan and wasted features</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flitted one sweet smile of peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eagerly he grasped the writing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am free!” at last he said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Backward fell upon the pillow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was free among the dead.</span>

			<p>
				<span>We took the badge from her bosom</span>

			<p>
				<span>Go work in my vineyard, said the Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gather the bruised grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the reapers had left the stubble bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I trod the soil in pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fields of my Lord are wide and broad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He has pastures fair and green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vineyards that drink the golden light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which flows from the sun’s bright sheen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I heard the joy of the reapers’ song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they gathered golden grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then wearily turned unto my task,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a lonely sense of pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sadly I turned from the sun’s fierce glare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sought the quiet shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over my dim and weary eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sleep’s peaceful fingers strayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I dreamed I joined with a restless throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eager for pleasure and gain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ever and anon a stumbler fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And uttered a cry of pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the eager crowd still hurried on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too busy to pause or heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a voice rang sadly through my soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You must staunch these wounds that bleed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My hands were weak, but I reached them out</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To feebler ones than mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over the shadows of my life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stole the light of a peace divine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! then my task was a sacred thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How precious it grew in my eyes!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas mine to gather the bruised grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the “Lord of Paradise.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when the reapers shall lay their grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the floors of golden light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I feel that mine with its broken sheaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be precious in His sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though thorns may often pierce my feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the shadows still abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mists will vanish before His smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There will be light at eventide.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Jamie’s Puzzle</h2>
			<p>
				<span>There was grief within our household</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because of a vacant chair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our mother, so loved and precious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer was sitting there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our hearts grew heavy with sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our eyes with tears were blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little Jamie was wondering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why we were left behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We had told our little darling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the land of love and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the saints all crowned with glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And enrobed in spotless white.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We said that our precious mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had gone to that land so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dwell with beautiful angels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to be forever there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the child was sorely puzzled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why dear grandmamma should go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dwell in a stranger city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When her children loved her so.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But again the mystic angel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came with swift and silent tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our sister, Jamie’s mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was enrolled among the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To us the mystery deepened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Jamie it seemed more clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grandma, he said, must be lonesome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mamma has gone to her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the question lies unanswered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In our little Jamie’s mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why she should go to our mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leave her children behind;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To dwell in that lovely city,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all that was dear to part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From children who loved to nestle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So closely around her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dear child, like you, we are puzzled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With problems that still remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But think in the great hereafter</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their meaning will all be plain.</span>

				<blockquote epub:type="epigraph">
					<p>The following news item appeared in the newspapers throughout the country, issue of December 27th, 1894:</p>
					<p>“Tim Thompson, a little negro boy, was asked to dance for the amusement of some white toughs. He refused, saying he was a church member. One of the men knocked him down with a club and then danced upon his prostrate form. He then shot the boy in the hip. The boy is dead: his murderer is still at large.”</p>

				<span>He lifted up his pleading eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scanned each cruel face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where cold and brutal cowardice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had left its evil trace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was when tender memories</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round Beth’lem’s manger lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mothers told their little ones</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Jesu’s natal day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And of the Magi from the East</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who came their gifts to bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bow in rev’rence at the feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Salem’s new-born King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And how the herald angels sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The choral song of peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That war should close his wrathful lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strife and carnage cease.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At such an hour men well may hush</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their discord and their strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er that manger clasp their hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gifts to brighten life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas! that in our favored land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cruelty and crime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should cast their shadows o’er a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fairest pearl of time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A dark-browed boy had drawn anear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A band of savage men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as a hapless lamb might stray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into a tiger’s den.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cruel and dull, they saw in him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sport an evil chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then demanded of the child</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give to them a dance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come dance for us,” the rough men said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I can’t,” the child replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I cannot for the dear Lord’s sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for my sins once died.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tho’ they were strong and he was weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wouldn’t his Lord deny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His life lay in their cruel hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he for Christ could die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Heard they aright? Did that brave child</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their mandates dare resist?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did he against their stern commands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have courage to resist?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then recklessly a man (?) arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dealt a fearful blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He crushed the portals of that life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laid the brave child low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And trampled on his prostrate form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As on a broken toy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then danced with careless, brutal feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the murdered boy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Christians! behold that martyred child!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His blood cries from the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the sleepless eye of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shows each gaping wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest crimson stain thy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When God shall inquisition make</span>

				<span class="i1">Thy brother’s wrongs forget.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Veil not thine eyes, nor close thy lips,</span>

				<span class="i1">For truth and justice stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Christless men, with reckless hands,</span>

				<span class="i1">Are sowing round thy path</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Night of Death</h2>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas a night of dreadful horror⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Death was sweeping through the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wings of dark destruction</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were outstretched from strand to strand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Strong men’s hearts grew faint with terror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the tempest and the waves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrecked their homes and swept them downward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suddenly to yawning graves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Mid the wastes of ruined households,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the tempest’s wild alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood a terror-stricken mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a child within her arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Other children huddled ’round her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each one nestling in her heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift in thought and swift in action,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She at least from one must part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she said unto her daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Strive to save one child from death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Which one?” said the anxious daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As she stood with bated breath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! the anguish of that mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What despair was in her eye!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All her little ones were precious;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which one should she leave to die?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then outspake the brother Bennie:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I will take the little one.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No,” exclaimed the anxious mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“No, my child, it can’t be done.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See! my boy, the waves are rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save yourself and leave the child!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will trust in Christ,” he answered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grasped the little one and smiled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through the roar of wind and waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever and anon she cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But throughout the night of terror</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never Bennie’s voice replied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But above the waves’ wild surging</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had found a safe retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if God had sent an angel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just to guide his wandering feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the storm had spent its fury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the sea gave up its dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She was mourning for her loved ones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost amid that night of dread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While her head was bowed in anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her ear there fell a voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bringing surcease to her sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding all her heart rejoice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Didn’t I tell you true?” said Bennie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his eyes were full of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“When I told you God would help me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the dark and dreadful night?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he placed the little darling</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oh! for faith so firm and precious,</span>

				<span>Till life’s gloom-encircled shadows</span>

				<span class="i1">To welcome thy dear guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To change thy weariness and care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For comfort, peace and rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Close to his side, oh! may I stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Just to behold his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I shall wear within my soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The image of his grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The grace that changes hearts of stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tenderness and love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bids us run with willing feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto his courts above.</span>

				<span>The treacherous sands had caught our boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And held it with a strong embrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And death at our imprisoned crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was sternly looking face to face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With anxious hearts, but failing strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We strove to push the boat from shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all in vain, for there we lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With bated breath and useless oar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Around us in a fearful storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fiery hail fell thick and fast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we engirded by the sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could not return the dreadful blast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When one arose upon whose brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ardent sun had left his trace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A noble purpose strong and high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplighting all his dusky face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Perchance within that fateful hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wrongs of ages thronged apace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with it came the glorious hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of swift deliverance to his race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of galling chains asunder rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of severed hearts again made one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of freedom crowning all the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through battles gained and victories won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Some one,” our hero firmly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Must die to get us out of this;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then leaped upon the strand and bared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bosom to the bullets’ hiss.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But ye are soldiers, and can fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May win in battles yet unfought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have no offering but my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if they kill me it is nought.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With steady hands he grasped the boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And boldly pushed it from the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then fell by rebel bullets pierced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His life work grandly, nobly o’er.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our boat was rescued from the sands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And launched in safety on the tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he our comrade good and grand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In our defence had bravely died.</span>

				<span>He stood before the sons of Heth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bowed his sorrowing head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I’ve come,” he said, “to buy a place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where I may lay my dead.</span>

				<span>Grant me a place where I may lay</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then tenderly the sons of Heth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gazed on the mourner’s face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “Oh, Prince, amid our dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Choose thou her resting-place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The sepulchres of those we love,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Against the plea thy grief hath made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We close not heart nor hand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The patriarch rose and bowed his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said, “One place I crave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis at the end of Ephron’s field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And called Machpelah’s cave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Entreat him that he sell to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her last sleep that cave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do not ask for her I loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The freedom of a grave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The son of Zohar answered him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Hearken, my lord, to me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before our sons, the field and cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I freely give to thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will not take it as a gift,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The grand old man then said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I pray thee let me buy the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where I may lay my dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with the promise in his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His seed should own that land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gave the shekels for the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took from Ephron’s hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And saw afar the glorious day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His chosen seed should tread,</span>

			<p>
				<span>She came from the East a fair, young bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a light and a bounding heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find in the distant West a home</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her husband to make a start.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He builded his cabin far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the prairie flower bloomed wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her love made lighter all his toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joy and hope around him smiled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She plied her hands to life’s homely tasks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And helped to build his fortunes up;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While joy and grief, like bitter and sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were mingled and mixed in her cup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He sowed in his fields of golden grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the strength of his manly prime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor music of birds, nor brooks, nor bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was as sweet as the dollar’s chime.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She toiled and waited through weary years</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the fortune that came at length;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But toil and care and hope deferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had stolen and wasted her strength.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cabin changed to a stately home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rich carpets were hushing her tread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But light was fading from her eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the bloom from her cheek had fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her husband was adding field to field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And new wealth to his golden store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little thought the shadow of death</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was entering in at his door.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Slower and heavier grew her step,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While his gold and his gains increased;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his proud domain had not the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her humble home in the East.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had no line to sound the depths</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her tears repressed and unshed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dreamed ’mid plenty a human heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could be starving, but not for bread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within her eye was a restless light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a yearning that never ceased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A longing to see the dear old home</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had left in the distant East.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A longing to clasp her mother’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nestle close to her heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to feel the heavy cares of life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like the sun-kissed shadows depart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hungry heart was stilled at last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its restless, baffled yearning ceased.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lonely man sat by the bier</span>

				<span class="i1">Of a corpse that was going East.</span>

				<span class="i1">Gaily issued forth a throng;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her humbler habitations</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved a human tide along.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Haughty dames and blooming maidens,</span>

				<span class="i1">Men who knew not mercy’s sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thronged into the Coliseum</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On that Roman holiday.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the lonely wilds of Asia,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her jungles far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the distant torrid regions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rome had gathered beasts of prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lions restless, roaring, rampant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tigers with their stealthy tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leopards bright, and fierce, and fiery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Met in conflict wild and dread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fierce and fearful was the carnage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the maddened beasts of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they fought and rent each other</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Urged by men more fierce than they.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till like muffled thunders breaking</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a vast and distant shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fainter grew the yells of tigers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the lions’ dreadful roar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the crimson-stained arena</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay the victims of the fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes which once had glared with anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost in death their baleful light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then uprose the gladiators</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed for conflict unto death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting for the prefect’s signal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cold and stern with bated breath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ave Cæsar, morituri,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Te, salutant,” rose the cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the lips of men ill-fated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doomed to suffer and to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then began the dreadful contest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lives like chaff were thrown away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rome with all her pride and power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Butchered for a holiday.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eagerly the crowd were waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud the clashing sabres rang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When between the gladiators</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All unarmed a hermit sprang.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cease your bloodshed,” cried the hermit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“On this carnage place your ban;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with flashing swords they answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Back unto your place, old man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From their path the gladiators</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrust the strange intruder back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who between their hosts advancing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calmly parried their attack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All undaunted by their weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood the old heroic man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While a maddened cry of anger</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the vast assembly ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Down with him,” cried out the people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As with thumbs unbent they glared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the prefect gave the signal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That his life should not be spared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Men grew wild with wrathful passion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When his fearless words were said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cruelly they fiercely showered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stones on his devoted head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bruised and bleeding fell the hermit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victor in that hour of strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaining in his death a triumph</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he could not win in life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had he uttered on the forum</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struggling thoughts within him born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men had jeered his words as madness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his deed they could not scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not in vain had been his courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for naught his daring deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his grave his mangled body</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did for wretched captives plead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From that hour Rome, grown more thoughtful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ceased her sport in human gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into her Coliseum</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gladiators came no more.</span>
